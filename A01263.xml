            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR THOMAS COVENTREY Knight, his Maiesties Attourney Generall: And to the vertuous and true Christian Lady, the Lady ELIZABETH his wife; Grace, mercy, and peace be multiplyed from God the Father, through our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worshipfull, and right deare in the Lord, I being desirous to leaue behind me (for after my dayes) some small portion of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer labours in the Ministerie of the Gospell, as an assured and infallible
<pb facs="tcp:2803:3"/> testimony of my vnfayned loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good &amp; saluation of that people, whose resident Pastor I haue beene almost the full space of forty yeeres, and resoluing that it should be the ensuing principles, with their seuerall Expositions: I now make bold to present them to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and vpon these two motiues to dedicate them to your worthy names.</p>
            <p>The one, that by this meanes they might remaine, as a perpetuall pledge, and euerliuing witnesse of my thankfulnes for your many great and vndeserued fauours, most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and cheerefully vouchsafed vnto myselfe, and vnto mine, from time to time.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:2803:3"/>
            <p>These could I expresse in their particulars, but I forbeare to doe it. And yet not so much to escape the reproach of flattery (wherewith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly by some I might be branded) as because you take no such delight, (as some others doe) in hearing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and commendations, though iustly deserued.</p>
            <p>The second reason is, that they might be a like euidence, and seale of my hearty, and vnfayned longing after your growth, and going on in grace and goodnes, according to the glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ: whereof though I haue no cause to doubt, yet can I not but desire it: &amp; desiring it (as I do) no other way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thē this, am I able to expresse it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:2803:4"/>
            <p>Famous, &amp; of great esteeme, and that right worthily, Sir, are you growne to be (the Lord be praised for it:) And that not only in regard of such eminent places, wherein it hath pleased God (by degrees, and in his appointed times) to set you: but for your learning, wisedome, and sufficiency, to the well discharge of all, and euery of them. But yet, if I may be bold, to speake what I conceiue, and rest perswaded of (with the ioynt opinion of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) this is nothing so precious for your good name, as your religious, vpright, and conscionable procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, appearing and shining to the view of all men, in the middest of thick and foggie mists of corruption,
<pb facs="tcp:2803:4"/> and when conscience among many is so little regarded. Heereby haue you gayned the loue, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all estates and degrees: yea many there are, that know not your person, who will not make mention of your name, without great respect.</p>
            <p>The like may I say of you also, Madame, that although you bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly qualified, (as God bee praised you are) with all good gifts of body and minde, that be fit orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and which adde a grace to your sex, and degree of calling, (as it is respected, and had in account among the men of this world) yet the honour and crowne of your good name, is the good report your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath gotten in the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:2803:5"/> God, among such as truly feare God, for your good and vertuous dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in matters of religion and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, for your modesty, meekenes, humility, and such like graces, as they appeare to be graces of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>And indeed, what reckoning is to be made of humane wisedome, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowledge, of riches, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of worldly honour and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (yea euen in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of them) if they be not found in the way of righteousnes? if they be not sanctified by the Spirit of God? Without this special blessing they do but puffe vp, and make onely a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shew, and a bare profession, without all care and conscience of
<pb facs="tcp:2803:5"/> an agreeable practice.</p>
            <p>Oh, let your Worships labour then (in a zealous vse of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed) for this so great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a grace (as is the grace of sanctification) that your high places and callings, your wisedome, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, riches, and all other good gifts which God hath bestowed vpon you, being seasoned and sweetned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, they may all ioyne together in a sweet harmony and sound consent, for the aduancement of Gods glory in your mortall bodies, and for the sure sealing and assurance of your owne saluation. And the Lord giue you not onely spirituall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, for a generall conceiuing
<pb facs="tcp:2803:6"/> out of his Word, what is to be done, and what not, but spirituall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome also for a right vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a right applying of it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>And thus not doubting of your fauourable acceptance of these my weake endeuours, for the reasons before remembred, commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and according to that of the Apostle <hi>Peter, 1.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued Brothren &amp; Sisters in the LORD: If there should bee a question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, who excels, and hath the preeminence, for birth,
<pb facs="tcp:2803:7"/> for riches, for credit, and countenance in the world; or for humane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, learning, and knowledge: This would bee found no ouer-hard or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible matter. But if it should bee questioned, what degrees there are of sinceritie and good affections to true Religion and godlinesse: this would not so easily be decided: The greatest part conceiting of themselues, that they are as neere to the Kingdome of Heauen, and walke as directly in the way that leadeth therunto, as the best.</p>
            <p>But I (my Brethren) endeuouring my selfe, (according to my place and calling) to be acquainted as well with your dispositions, and inclinations, as with your persons, (that so I might know the better, how to giue euery one his portion, and that in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) perceiue plainely among you, a very great difference. And although it bee not my office to looke into any mans heart, but as the words of his
<pb facs="tcp:2803:7"/> mouth, and the actions of his life doe discouer the same, and make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: Neither am able, (if it were fit) to take a particular view, of the priuate and particular demeanour of euery one: Yet, if I be asked, how well I can call my Sheepe by their names;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.3.</note> and what is the estate and condition of this little flocke: I speake it in the presence of God, (for I am so perswaded in my conscience, and finde by experience) that as there are some few amongst you truely fearing God, endeuouring to approue their hearts and liues vnto God, and to manifest that grace that is wrought in them, by the fruits of grace, &amp; who desire (in the vse of such ordinary meanes as the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed) to grow, and flourish, as greene Gardens, and as Trees planted by the Riuers of waters, in all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of sanctification, not only for their owne peculiar good, and for the sure sealing of their owne saluation; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="tcp:2803:8"/> for the good &amp; saluation of others, according to their places and callings, and that measure of spirituall gifts which they haue receiued:</p>
            <p>(A second sort also, who although they bee not so well grounded and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in Religion as the former; and therefore cannot possibly either haue such peace in themselues, or make such conscience of all their wayes: yet are tractable, willing to be instructed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, and reformed: And thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing good hope of a comfortable proceeding in the way of godlinesse and saluation:)</p>
            <p>So, are there many (on th'other side) whose mindes and affections are so wholly set vpon the profits &amp; pleasures of this world, as that they seem almost vtterly vncapable of the heauenly things. If they come to the Church (as sometimes they doe) when the holy exercises of Religion are in hand, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are asleepe, or so giue place
<pb facs="tcp:2803:8"/> to idle, and carnall cogitations, that they nothing profit by any thing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: but returne to their houses as carelesse and secure, as ignorant and sencelesse in the mysteries of saluation, as they came from thence. Nay, some of them as vaine and common swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; as wilful prophaners of the Lords day; as malicious, as proud and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, as filthy talkers, as very lyers, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, tale-carryers, Alehouse-haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the like, as euer before. The Word of God sounds in their eares, but can take no rooting in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Now of this third sort there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; (as I said before) yea, some such there are manifestly faulty in some of these, who in regard of their yeeres, education, and wealth, should be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instructed, and giue better exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>They that are thus affected, as they cannot loue the Minister whom God
<pb facs="tcp:2803:9"/> hath set ouer them, because hee is Christs Minister, nor yet any other that truely feare God, because they doe so; but are very ready vpon all occasions to oppose against such, to disgrace, despight, and discourage them to the vttermost of their power. So very small delight can either the Minister or any of the rest take in them againe: And so much the lesse, because seldome, or neuer, shall you heare any of these either penitently acknowledge any thing in them to be amisse; or in humility desire to bee taught and instructed, but (puffed vp with high conceits) are ready rather to wrest and peruert wholesome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; yea, peremptorily to censure and controll, whatsoeuer either disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth their corruptions, or crosseth their peeuish and peruerse affections, how well grounded so euer it bee vpon the Word of God.</p>
            <p>This (my Brethren) is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:2803:9"/> state and condition wherein (so farre as I am able to discerne) you presently stand. And let no man bee offended for this manner of discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, seeing it is done in the presence of GOD, and of his Church, vpon grounded experience, and without the touch of any mans person in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: For conscience also of my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that euery one of you might be the better mooued, and stirred vp to try and examine your seuerall soules, and finde how the case stands betwixt God and them.</p>
            <p>As I obserue this difference among the men of this Congregation; so hath late experience (much against my hope and expectation) discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the like betwixt you that are the women. But not iudging it fit in this manner to stand longer vpon it; I will onely admonish and put you in mind of these two things, which haue been formerly taught and applyed vnto
<pb facs="tcp:2803:10"/> you. The one, that the nature and sexe of women is no sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or excuse; wherefore you may lawfully, or safely continue in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of heauenly things: or why the Word of God should not dwel in you plenteously,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16</note> in all wisedome and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>The other is, that seeing it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end of your Creation, that you should bee helpers;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18.</note> that therefore in the feare of God, according to the notable examples of <hi>Priscilla,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.3, 12.</note> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther godly women (whose praise is in the Scripture) you endeuour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the same end of your creation, in being helpers not onely at all times,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 3.</note> and in all good things to your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; but also to the Minister (as shee was to the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>) and vnto one another, in spending some part of the time, when you are together at one anothers house, and at womens labours, and when you feast and gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sip
<pb facs="tcp:2803:10"/> together, for the edifying of one another in the holy Faith; by asking questions, and by calling that to mind which hath beene publikely taught, by exhorting, admonishing, and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging one another in the way of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and by all other good meanes, as occasion is offered.</p>
            <p>And that it may appeare to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, to the ioy and comfort of all such as feare God, and to the silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the contrary-minded, that the saluation of you all, hath beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeuoured, and sought after; I haue published this little Treatise, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining those speciall, and choise Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Christian Religion, vvith their seuerall Expositions (as neere as I could both for matter and forme) which you haue in writing, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not long since, you haue beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</p>
            <p>These doe I desire to leaue behinde mee, for a perpetuall Testimonie and
<pb facs="tcp:2803:11"/> pledge of my true and vnfained loue towards you all, and as my last Will and Testament; wherein I bequeath vnto you the very best gifts and Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which I haue to bestow. Onely, whereas in other Testaments vvhich concerne goods, and Lands, the death of the Testator giues life and power to the Will that is made, and vvhich before is of none effect: It is my will and hearty desire (if it may so also please God) that the Legacies thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and bequeathed, may be possessed, and enioyed of you (to whom they are meant) euen whiles I liue. And that howsoeuer the time of my disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution cannot now be farre of; and my desire is to benefit many (yea euen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death) yet, that I may liue to see some fruit of them, before I goe hence, and be no more.</p>
            <p>Herein (my beloued) shall you more comfort the feeble spirits, and bring greater ioy, and gladnesse of
<pb facs="tcp:2803:11"/> heart to the ancient yeeres, and last breath of your deceasing Pastor (when God cals for it) then hath been all sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and griefe conceiued, for, and in regard of any former iniuries, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses: what, and how great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
            <p>And now, my last request is, that you, who haue religiously harkened vnto these Principles, and doctrines of Religion when they were preached, would be as diligent in reading, and meditating vpon them, beeing thus brought into the light; for the better establishing, and confirmation of your hearts &amp; minds in the truth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1.</note>
               <hi>for it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me not to write the same things vnto you; and for you it is a sure thing.</hi> And that you (on the other side) who haue carelesly regarded them in times past, would take the opportunity which the Lord doth offer, in thus putting them into your hands, and in laying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine before your eyes, to redeeme the
<pb facs="tcp:2803:12"/> time past with a more religious care and conscience of the glory of God, and of your owne saluation. For the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of your eyes, &amp; sanctifying of your hearts &amp; affections whereunto: I heartily pray and beseech the Lord.</p>
            <p>And whereas (good M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
               <hi>White</hi>) I am thus bold to make choise of your name (amongst all rest of the neighbours) in this Dedication: I haue done it for two especiall Reasons, and respects. First, that by this publike testimony of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all respect, I might the better expresse the great desire which I haue of such true and vnfained loue in your selfe, and in yours, as whereof many yeeres together in the good neighbourhood, and godly conuersation of your decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed parents, I had good experience, and content: And that as a Successor in grace, as well as in nature, you shew and approue your selfe constant &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute for the nourishing and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of it; and not suffer the same by
<pb facs="tcp:2803:12"/> the suggestions and subtilties of the contrary-minded, of such as are ill-af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fected in this kind, to be remoued frō you, or stolne out of your heart. The which to your worthy praise and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation in the Churh of God, will be so much the more, because such a succession and descent of true ancient loue towards their Minister in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of almost all the rest, is much decayd, if it be not already euen vtterly extinguished, and come to nought.</p>
            <p>The second reason is, that by this meanes, you might in a more speciall manner, be prouoked and stirred vp to true zeale, and seruency of Spirit, as well for the right vnderstanding, as for the profession and practise of these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Doctrines, and Principles of our Faith: wherin (together with the rest) you haue formerly beene instructed: And that not onely in regard of your own peculiar good, and saluation, and of those that are committed to your
<pb facs="tcp:2803:13"/> charge in your owne particular Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but for the good example also, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, incouraging, and drawing on of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hers. For being the chiefe (through the Lords bounty and goodnes) in this place of your aboad, and hauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of all sorts vpon you: it is well worthy your serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and godly regard; how much more, then many others, you may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God; and what great good you may doe among your neighbours, in be ng a godly president, and patterne of Religion and vertue, in your life and conuersation, in shewing a good and cheerefull countenance, and in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a true and sincere loue to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospell of Iesus Christ, both in the Ministery, and in the profession of it; hauing no fellowship (in the meane season) with vnfruitfull works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but eschewing and auoiding them from the bottome of your heart. And (good Sir) bee you well assured,
<pb facs="tcp:2803:13"/> that God doth require, and will looke for all this at your hands.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Christian Religion consisteth in a true and sincere acknowledging of that truth, which is according to godlines.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That truth doth teach vs what we are to know and beleeue, concerning God, and
<pb facs="tcp:2803:18"/> what wee are to know and beleeue concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our selues.</p>
            <p n="4">4 God is a Spirit, which is most simple, most holy, eternall, infinite, of inestimable glory, maiesty, and power, all-sufficient, onely wise, onely good, most iust, most mercifull, and therefore one. There are three eternall, and equall persons of the Godhead, distinguished by their proper dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but yet not separated one from another. The Father, the Sonne, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Wee are to know concerning our selues, what we are by nature, and what by grace.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Wee are by nature the children of wrath, full of sinne and corruption, and heires of hell and condemnation.</p>
            <p n="7">7 By grace we are freed from the power and dominion of sinne: Of the children of wrath wee are made children, and heires of God, yea coheires with Christ.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Christ is the eternall Sonne of GOD, perfect GOD, and perfect man in one person.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Christ, as touching his Godhead, was without beginning, of one, and the same essence, and being with the Father equall,
<pb facs="tcp:2803:18"/> and all one with him, in glory, maiesty, and power: and he became man, when he took to his diuine nature, our flesh in the wombe of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> like vnto vs in all things, except sinne.</p>
            <p n="10">10 It was a matter of so great necessity, in regard of our saluation, that Christ should haue two natures, and be in one person both God and man, that he could not otherwise haue ouercome death and the deuill, vnder whose captiuity wee were holden, neither haue satisfied Gods iustice for our sinnes, nor reconciled vs vnto him.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Christ performed this (according to his flesh and humane nature) by his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and sufferings, wherein hee became obedient vnto the death, euen to the death of the Crosse.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Christ his obedience, and the fruit and effect of his humiliation and sufferings, are applyed vnto vs, and made ours, by a true and liuely faith.</p>
            <p n="13">13 A true and liuely faith, is a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall worke, wrought in the heart of man, by the Spirit of God, whereby wee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, receiue, and apply vnto our selues, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, with all his benefits, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and redemption.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb facs="tcp:2803:19"/>14 The ordinary meanes whereby the holy Ghost doth worke this faith in the hearts of Gods children, is the ministery and preaching of the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="15">15 This faith is nourished, strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and confirmed, by hearing the same Word of God preached and read, as also by prayer, conference, and partaking the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            <p n="16">16 A Sacrament is a publike worke of the Church, instituted by our Lord Iesus Christ, and consisting of a visible signe, or signes, whereby the promises of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the free forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and euerlasting life, are firmely confirmed, and sealed vp in our hearts.</p>
            <p n="17">17 There are onely two Sacraments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by our Lord Iesus Christ: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptisme, and the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>

                  <p>In the Primitiue Church (after the dayes of the Apostles) there were two sorts of such, as were catechized, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Grounds and Principles of Religion.</p>

                  <p>The second sort, were such as were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2803:22"/> borne in the Church, as the children of Christians, who with all conuenient speed, after their birth, were baptized, as members of the Church. Afterward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instructed, they were likewise recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the Sacrament of the Supper.

Another maine and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> especiall reason is, because the knowledge and faith of these things, is as necessarie to the well-being, and sound estate of a Christian man, as a good and sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is to an house, or other building. For euen, as if the foundation be not sure, and good, whatsoeuer is builded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon cannot possibly stand: so, in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer these doctrines and beginnings of Christianitie are not settled, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished: let such a one make what faire shew hee will, and attaine to as much other knowledge as hee can, yet is all

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2803:25"/> alack, if we examine the matter, how far are the greatest part of our houses, from being (as it were) such little Churches?

It being in very deed, an vnseemely thing, for such
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2803:26"/> as haue the preaching of the Gospell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, to be alwayes sticking in the first grounds of Religion; yea, euen as monstrous, as it is to remaine alwayes a child, and not to grow from the degrées of infancy, hauing fit meanes, and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment orderly applyed. We haue heard the Principles of Religion, with other Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Gospell, plainely, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly taught: we haue had liberty, and opportunity, many dayes and yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to meditate vpon them, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise our selues in them. Is it not then a very great shame, and an intolerable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnesse, that wee should continue to bee herein but as little children, that know not the right hand from the left? If we should be asked any question touching our worldly affaires, we can (for the most part) giue a ready answere, and render a sound reason of that we say: but if we be asked any question, touching our estate before God, and how the case standeth with vs concerning Faith, repentance, peace of Conscience, and other like gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Sanctification: wee will many of vs be found mute, and know not what to say; yea, and which is most of all lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2803:26"/> to consider, nothing at all are we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed for the most part, to consider our ignorance, in this behalfe: This old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish poison hath so infected mens hearts, that ignorance is the mother of deuotion; And that if they can say the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp;c. If they come to the Church, and goe vnder the names of Christians, and Protestants, it is sufficient. And more precisenesse then necessary, to labour for further perfection: wherein they wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly deceiue themselues.</p>
                  <p>But to help and remedy this (as much as is possible) remember alwayes (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, Brethren) and keepe this in minde, that the best Christians, and such as be indued with greatest graces, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre from being thus conceited of themselues.

And that he on the other side, which thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of himselfe, either that he is already forward enough; or that a little more
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2803:27"/> knowledge, zeale, or holinesse will serue the turne: Such a man hath vndoubtedly no true zeale, no true holinesse, no sound knowledge or Religion at all.

Many there are at this day (the Lord knoweth) of whom it may truely be said, that they are growne to be old and ancient men and women in yeeres; but yet remaine very children in knowledge and vnderstanding of heauenly matters: Neere vnto death, and so to the saluation of their soules, (as a man would thinke▪) when their age is considered, but very farre from the same, doe they plainely shew themselues to be, when their Religion, and godlinesse, and the fruits of their loue to the Preachers, and professors of the Gospell, bee duely examined, and regarded. And which is most lamentable to consider, as none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are more ignorant, then the elder sort of men and women: so, none more carelesse of instruction, nor any more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt, or vnwilling to be taught.</p>
                  <p>I haue knowne many in this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, euen from their childhood; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest, some of them twenty
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2803:27"/> yeeres, some ten, some more, and some lesse: In all which space, as they cannot deny but that they haue had sufficient time: So may I boldly, and with good conscience (I praise God) affirme, that they haue had meanes in some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to be nourished in the way of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to be builded vp towards Gods Kingdome, in the sanctifying graces of his blessed Spirit. But can it bee said withall, that they haue receiued this nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, and are so builded vp? It were surely a blessed and comfortable thing, if this might truely be so verified, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: And that the contrary were not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too apparant, to our worthy shame, and reproofe. Many of vs are growne in wealth, but not in Religion; growne in yeeres, but not in grace. Nothing at all nearer, but rather much further from sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, then so long agoe; yea, I say, then ten, or twenty yeeres since. Stepping a foot forward (as it were) some Sabbath dayes when they list to come to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church, and to lend an eare to the hearing of Gods Word: but running much faster from it, euen the greatest part of those very daies, besides all the other dayes of the weekes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2803:28"/> following: It being out of doubt, that one little sleepe, or sluggish fit, in the time of preaching, and Prayer; one vaine Oath, the cherishing of one corrupt affection, be it either to anger, malice, incontinency, oppression, &amp;c. the exercise of the tongue in one vaine word, bee it in swearing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mocking, slandering, and the like: Any one of these (I say) or any such like, set a man much further backe in the way of saluation, then all the labour and paines that a Minister of Christ can take in preaching, exhortation, and doctrine will be able to helpe him forward againe in many dayes. The way to Heauen is an ascent, and a going vpwards; but this is a declining and a going downewards. And easily (as wee know) may a man goe much further downe a steepe Hill in the space of one houre, then hee shall be able to recouer againe in many houres, though he sweat, and take neuer so much paines to doe it.</p>
                  <p>But now to make an end of this point. As the Papists are euidently discouered to haue hard hearts, and to bee deadly enemies to the saluation of Gods people, in denying them the Bread of Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2803:28"/> which, there can be nothing but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death. And as this which hath been spoken, bewrayeth the wretched, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable condition of all the rest: So, it teacheth vs, not onely to glorifie God, and to praise his Name, for vouchsafing vs the pure preaching, and free passage of his Word, with freedome to heare it, to learne it, and to make profession of it: but also to pray, and beseech him, for the gracious assistance of his blessed Spirit, together with the Ministerie and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, that so wee may not enioy so great a grace in vaine, but take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie (whiles hee in mercy doth vouchsafe it) to bee builded vp from one degree of holinesse to another, euen vntill we become perfect members of Iesus Christ, and enioy eternall life.</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. What is Christian Religion?</head>
               <p>Answ. <hi>Christian Religion consisteth in a true, &amp; sincere acknowledging of that truth, which is according to godlinesse,</hi> Tit. 1.1.2. Pet. 1.3. 1. Tim. 6.3.</p>
               <div type="exposition">
                  <head>EXPOSITION.</head>
                  <p>THis terme, or phrase of speech, <hi>Religion,</hi> is deriued from a word which signifieth to forsake, or leaue off, because thereby wee leaue and forsake false gods, all errours, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desires, and seeke after the True God, after truth, and heauenly things. It signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a friendship, a knitting, a vnity or league, with the true, and euerlasting God. And sometimes it is set forth also by the name of Marriage, or Wedlocke. For as they that are confederate, are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, and made one by a League, or Couenant: so God and Man are knit together by Religion. And as by marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the Husband, and the Wife, are made one body: so by Religion we are knit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a spirituall body with God, and with the Sonne of God, as with our Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, and Head. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2803:29"/> that whosoeuer are not truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, they haue no fellowship at all with God; they are no members of Iesus Christ; they are not sealed to eternall life, but Truce-breakers, disloyall, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous before the face of God. Secondly, when wee speake of Christian Religion, wee meane the Religion of Iesus Christ. For the word Christian, is deriued from Christ, of whom wee haue the name of Christians, being vnseparably knit vnto him, by true Faith, and being members of that body, whereof he is the Head.</p>
                  <p>But to passe from the meaning of the words, vnto the matter. <hi>Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consisteth in a true, and sincere acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of that truth, &amp;c.</hi> In these words where it is said not simply, that Christian Religion consisteth in the knowledge, but in the acknowledging, or confession of the Truth: And not in a bare, or verball, but in such a confession, or acknowledging as is sincere, and true: these two points are especially offered to our consideration. First, what euery true Christian must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and make profession of: and secondly, how and after what manner the fame must be done.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:2803:30"/>
                  <p>As touching the first; Euery tongue ought to confesse to the glory of God, as the whole truth which he hath reuealed in his Word: so especially the faith, and hope, which we haue in Christ Iesus to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life: yea, euen the whole doctrine of that our faith and Religion, boldly, and publikely, as occasion is offered. In this sence doth the Apostle writing to the <hi>Hebrewes, chapter 3.</hi> call Christ Iesus <hi>the High Priest of our profession.</hi>

                     </gap> will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2803:30"/> labour to make it yet more apparant, by some speciall reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, the confession of our Faith, and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> hope in Christ Iesus, hath a great promise of a rich reward, ioyned with it, and added vnto it; whereas the starting backe from it, hath on the contrary a grieuous curse. As both parts hereof are plaine, in the words of our Sauiour, <hi>Math. 10.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 10.32, 33.</note>
                     <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall confesse mee before men, him will I also confesse before my Father which is in Heauen; and whosoeuer shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in Heauen.</hi> And to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of Christ, before his Father: what is it else, but to bee vtterly cast out of his presence, and from all partaking of his grace, and fauour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this confession is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> fruit, and consequence of Faith. For where true Faith is in the heart, there will follow confession with the mouth, as <hi>2. Cor. 4.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.</note>
                     <hi>Because</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>wee haue the same Spirit of Faith, according as it is written; I beleeued, and therefore haue I spoken: We also beleeue, and therefore speake.</hi> Hee that is either afraid, or asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to confesse Christ and his Gospell
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2803:31"/> with the mouth: such a one vndoubtedly, hath not the true Faith of Christ in his heart. <hi>If thou shalt confesse the Lord Iesus with thy mouth,</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 10</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10.</note>) <hi>and beleeue in thy heart, that God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him from the dead, thou shalt be saued. For with the heart, man beleeueth vnto righteousnesse; and with the mouth, man confesseth to saluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, how acceptable a thing it is in the sight of God; what an excellent branch <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> of true Christianity; how necessary for the sealing and assurance of our saluation, to adioyne a sincere confession of the mouth, with a faithfull beleeuing of the heart. It is further confirmed, <hi>Psal. 116.</hi>

Whereby the truth of this point is cleerely confirmed, that herein we haue a notable argument, that wee are true Christians indeed, and doe vndoubtedly belong to eternall life: if we haue so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by the preaching of the Gospell, as that together with the planting, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of a true, &amp; liuely faith in Christ Iesus, to the free, and particular forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our sinnes, to our iustification, and saluation: We finde our selues able in some acceptable measure, and zealous, and willing according to our measure, to make profession hereof, without waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and without being ashamed of the same. Whereas on the contrary, how great a fault, and how vntolerable an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnesse it is, either not to know
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2803:32"/> how to make this confession, or to deny it, or to be ashamed of it: besides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words of our Sauiour himselfe, <hi>Math. 10.</hi> which I alledged before: This is further manifest, <hi>2. Tim. 2.</hi>

                     <hi>If we deny him, he will also deny vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let vs consider what profitable v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses may be made of this.</p>

                  <p>Hauing spoken at large, of the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, or confession of the truth: Now, as touching the second part of this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to make it also as plaine, that Christian Religion consisteth not in a verball, but in a true, and sincere confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or acknowledging of the truth: That is is not inough to professe Christ, and his Gospell, and to be sound, and resolute in the matter but that the manner also must be duely respected, that it bee sincere, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, vnfained, and free from all hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and dissimulation: Let vs obserue, and know, that such professors only haue euermore been accepted, and approued of God. There haue alwayes beene two sorts of such, as haue made profession of the truth: the profession of the one sort, consisting onely in words, and outward shewes: but the profession of the other, not onely outward, but proceeding from a

Of both these sorts, had our Lord Iesus Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <hi>Iohn 6.</hi> Some of the Iewes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him from place to place, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and good hearts, vnfainedly desiring to be taught, and instructed by him in the way of saluation; not murmuring when they heard any thing deliuered which they vnderstood not; nor taking any occasion to be so offended, as to forsake, and giue him ouer: but they constantly cleaued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and continued with him, as with the Sonne of God, and the onely Lord of life, and saluation.</p>
                  <p>But another sort, and as it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the greater part followed him, with more regard of their bellies, then of their soules, hoping, that hee would haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fed them to the full, and plentifully furnished them with all manner of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good things, without any care, or paines on their behalfe.

                     </gap>eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: They haue onely a shew of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and godlinesse, being void of al faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience towards God. But the Religion of the other sort is in all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, righteousnesse, and truth, they still endeuouring to practise, and performe in the whole course of their conuersation, whatsoeuer they know and professe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will and Word of God. They content not themselues in saying, Lord, Lord: we are Christians; wee are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants; and we professe the Gospel: but they haue a care, and conscience to amend their liues, and to bee reformed in that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2803:37"/> which is amisse: Whose knowledge is not fruitlesse, nor their faith dead, but they are zealously inflamed to walke according to their knowledge, and to approue their faith to be liuely, with the liuely fruits of holinesse, and righteousnesse. As the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites greatest care is to be well estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of among men: So, the true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, how he may be well approued of in the sight of God.

And the Reasons are: First, because the promises of Gods <label type="milestone">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> And secondly, because God abhorreth all halting in his seruice, and will not accept the hart by halues, nor be serued by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, <hi>1. Sam. 15.</hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2803:38"/> but hauing a reuerend feare of the Lords Maiesty imprinted in our hearts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in our soules, respecting his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed will, and faithfully remembring his vnmeasurable loue, and tender kindnesse towards vs in Christ Iesus: Wee must performe all outward circumstances, in comming to the Church, in hearing the Word, &amp;c. as fruits of our true, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward zeale to Gods glory, and as testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of our obedience, and thankefulnesse to his Maiesty, in regard of his manifold mercies towards vs, and then shall we be accepted in them, and in euery of them.

                  <hi>Que.</hi> 3. What doth that truth teach vs?</head>
               <p>Answ. <hi>What wee are to know, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue concerning God; and what to know, and beleeue, concerning our selues,</hi> Ier. 9.23, 24. Io. 17.3. Col. 2.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>ALthough very high, and exquisite is the true knowledge, &amp; very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the points and principall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of our Christian Religion, wherein, euery one that looketh to be saued by the Death of Christ, ought soundly to bee grounded, and established: yet may they all be comprehended, and knit vp in these two: to know God, and to know our selues. Insomuch, that if we know God truely, and as he ought to be knowne: and on the other side know our selues, as wee ought to know our selues: then haue we attained to an excellent measure of true Christian knowledge: whereas contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, if wee be without this knowledge of God, and of our selues, what shew so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we make in the world, and what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion soeuer we haue of our selues: yet
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2803:42"/> can wee haue no true peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor sound ioy in the holy Ghost: wee can haue no assurance that wee are right Christians, but euen strangers from the Couenant of Grace, who haue no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among the Saints. But if any, at the hearing of this, be ready to imagine that this is an easie knowledge, and may soone be attained: let not such deceiue themselues, but seriously consider, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that whereas our Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is said to consist in the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of our selues: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not, that it is sufficient for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man to know, that there is a God; but (as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> saith, he must know, and vnderstand, that the Lord is God: that hee sheweth mercy; and how, for what cause, and to whom hee sheweth mercy: that hee worketh righteousnesse, and executeth iudgement: and how, and for what cause, he doth these things in the earth. We must know him to be our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly True God and Iesus Christ whom hee hath sent, to be our alone Sauiour, and Redeemer. Again, concerning our selues, it is not inough to know, that wee are creatures created by God, but wee must
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2803:42"/> know, how, by what meanes, and so what end we were created, in what estate wee remaine, and in what estate we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, in respect of saluation, before God. It is not then so easie a matter to haue this knowledge in substance and truth, as many are apt to thinke, the whole summe of true wisedome, and godlinesse, beeing comprehended in it. We that are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and preachers of the Gospell, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all our study about this knowledge, and yet are neuer able to attaine the height, and fulnesse of it.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor</hi> 13.9.</note> When we haue done all we can, yet wee still know but in part, and prophesie but in part: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how farre the common and generall multitude, which little, or neuer study vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on she matter, and little profit by that which is taught them: how farre (I say) they must of necessity be, from a full, and sufficient measure of vnderstanding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, euery mans conscience cannot but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him. When wee thinke vpon God, we see, that infinite are the things, which may sooner be sought, and inquired, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the knowledge of him, then either found out, or plainely expounded. For which cause, we must neuer speake, nor
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2803:43"/> thinke of him, without great reuerence, and Religion. And to the end we may doe so, wee must alwayes consider on the one side, how great, and vnsearchable his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty is; and what worship, feare, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is due vnto him. And on the other side, how vile, and abiect our owne estate and condition is; how weake, or rather how corrupt, and peruerse iudgement we are, especially in those things that do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne diuine and spirituall vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For this is the right way to true Christian wisedome, and knowledge. And these two parts of it are so linked and knit together with a mutuall knot, that which of them goeth before, or ingendreth the other, it is a hard matter to discusse. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> For whosoeuer knoweth not God, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly know himselfe; And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer knoweth not himselfe, hee cannot possibly know God. And such a one, as is ignorant both of the knowledge of God, and of himselfe, he is ignorant of all happinesse, that may any way concerne himselfe; his estate is most miserable, what shew so euer to the contrary, he may carry in the world, to bleare the eyes of men.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> of himselfe, and his owne misery, not onely pricked forward to seeke God, but led, as it were, by the hand, to finde him out: so is it also certaine, that a man neuer commeth to the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, vnlesse hee hath first beheld the face of God, and from the beholding thereof, doe descend to the consideration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. For such is the pride, that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally planted in vs, that wee alwayes thinke our selues to bee righteous, wise, and holy inough, vntill such time, as wee be manifestly conuinced of our owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse, filthinesse, and vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: the which is done, not by looking vpon our selues onely; but vpon the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty also, and holinesse that is in God, which is the rule, whereby this iudgement is to be tryed. For in as much as we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to hypocrisie, a certaine vaine resemblance of righteousnes doth sufficiently content vs, in stead of true righteousnes indeed. So long as we looke no further then the earth, we wonderfully please, and sweetly flatter our selues, in our owne wisedome, power, &amp; strength; but if wee once begin to raise vp our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2803:44"/> thoughts to God, and to consider what a one he is, and how exact is the perfection of his righteousnes, wisedome, &amp; power, after the rule whereof we ought to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: then, that which before did please vs in our selues with a false pretence of righteousnes, shall become loathsome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as very hainous wickednesse: that which did maruellously deceiue vs vnder the colour of wisedome, shall then stinke before vs as extreme folly: that which did beare the face of strength, shall be proued to be most miserable weakenesse: So slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly doth that which is good in our eyes, answere in proportion, the excellent pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that is in God.</p>
               <p>Much more might be added to amplifie this: but we shal haue occasion to consider further of it, in the next point. In the meane season, you may see by this already deliuered, how rightly the summe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, is said to consist in the knowledge of God, and of our selues.</p>
               <p>For as the true knowledge of God doth rightly bring sauing health; and as the same aboundantly sufficeth to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and saluation to all faithfull Christians: And againe, as without this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2803:44"/> knowledge, all other knowledge is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth. It being euen <hi>eternall</hi> life, as Christ himselfe affirmeth, thus to know God: euen so y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> knowledge of our selues, and of our owne miseries, is necessarie to the obtaining of inestimable comfort and consolation. And as to bee ignorant of God, is a damnable ignorance: so also not to know our owne wretchednesse, is a blindnesse most miserable.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore bee zealous in prayer continually vnto God, <label type="milestone">

And yet, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, such is our estate and condition, who are mortall men liuing in this world, that wee can bee ignorant of nothing, with greater danger: forasmuch as to this end we were created, and are called to heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace; that we should know, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, worship, feare, serue, and glorifie him. For this cause, not grounding any opinion vpon mens determinations, or weake definitions, (lest wee worship the inuentions of our own hearts, and follow the toyes of foolish braines:) but that we may speake rightly, iudge truely, and to the honour of his high and heauenly Maiesty: Let this alwaies stand with vs for a perpetuall rule, that God cannot bee rightly knowne, but by his Word; and that if wee curiously search, and inquire further of him then the Scriptures doe teach, we are worthy to be blinded, and punished for ouer-great presumptiō.

If wee diligently search, and examine our selues, wee may finde this corruption of nature, euen in our best actions, and of greatest deuotion. I will discouer it in one, or two, that you may the better discerne it in all the rest. When through the motion of Gods Spirit wee prepare our selues to prayer; if we looke into the corners of our hearts, wee shall finde much vnfitnesse for so holy an action, and no such cheerefulnesse as we ought to haue: and in the action it selfe of prayer, great weaknesse, many idle and wandring
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2803:68"/> cogitations, and so, as very often, wee haue one thing in our mouthes, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in our mindes.

               <p>Thus you see, how wee are fréed from the power and dominion of sinne, not by any worke of flesh and bloud, but by the grace of God, according to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</note>

So that this withall is necessary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, that this freedome from the power and dominion of sinne, this grace of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and new birth, is onely begun in the children of God in this life, through the grace and power of the Spirit of God, and neuer so fully perfected or finished whiles we are here, but that there remain many remnants of the flesh, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually following corrupt affections, doe so moue warre against the Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part, that wee cannot haue any motion that is pure and vncorrupt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we performe any action so sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfectly as we desire: As this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2803:71"/> Now among some other, there are these two especial reasons, wherefore the Lord doth onely begin, and not perfect our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in this life. First, that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> (so long as we are in this earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle) no end or stay of the conflict and combate betwixt the Spirit and the flesh, we might haue so much the more longing after the glory and blessednesse of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Kingdome, wherein wee shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before God, perfectly righteous, and perfectly holy. A second reason is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> that the Lords power may be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in our weakenesse, and that seeing we are saued by meere grace,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.23, 24</note> and not by workes: our reioycing might not be in our selues, but onely in God, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ier.</hi> exhorteth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Concerning the worke of redemption, in a further consideration, how we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the guiltinesse of sinne, and from the slauery of Satan, and so, as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</note>
                  <hi>There is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus.</hi> Wee shall haue fit occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, when we come to the 10. and 11. questions. And therefore not now to enter into it, but to make some vse of that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2803:72"/> which hath already beene spoken.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> First, seeing God is the Author of this our freedome, from the power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of sinne, that therefore wee ascribe the honour and prerogatiue of so great a grace onely vnto him, and feeling the same spirituall worke of our new birth in any measure begun in vs, let vs yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maiestie vnfayned praise and thanks.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>2</label> Secondly, let vs learne to know and vnderstand the greatnesse and excellencie of this grace of God, that wee may prize and esteeme it according to the worth and worthinesse thereof. For this is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and point of doctrine, which vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naturall man soundeth very harsh, and seemeth most strange, yea too nice and precise: Few there he that rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what it meaneth, and fewer that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and entertaine it, when they doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, with any liking, or delight.

None at all take pleasure in it, those few onely excepted, in whom this change is begun, through the mighty working of Gods Spirit. It is therefore vndoubtedly to be accounted a speciall gift of Gods grace, if when we heare this truth of doctrine prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto vs, we perceiue our eyes to be opened for a right conceiuing, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of it, and our hearts and mindes illuminated, and entertaining of it.

               <p>For a third vse; let vs take it to heart, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> and resolue vpon it, as a most certaine and infallible truth, that there is no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2803:73"/> at this day, neither euer was there any from the beginning of the world, (our Lord Iesus Christ onely excepted) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were neuer so learned, neuer so holy, and righteous, but he had great néed of this new birth; of this freedome from the power and dominion of sinne; yea, so great need, that without the same, it was vtterly vnpossible for him to be saued. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus,</hi> was a man, not only of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedst sort amongst the Iewes, but euen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the best affectioned to the feare of God: and yet we may see, <hi>Ioh</hi> 3. how our Lord Iesus Christ would not exempt him from this second birth, but tels him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he must <hi>be borne againe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3 7.</note> or else hee could not possibly bee a fit member for Gods Kingdome. And therefore maruell not (said he) <hi>that I say vnto thee, Yee must be borne againe.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> was an excellent, holy, and good man, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods owne heart, as the Scripture testifieth; &amp; yet, in what high account he had this grace of regeneration, his earnest prayer to God for it, <hi>Psa.</hi> 51.<note place="margin">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2803:73"/> and chosen vessell of the Lord, a notable instrument in the Church of Christ, for the conuersion and saluation of infinite multitudes: and yet, what great need he had of his deliuerance from the bondage of corruption, it appeareth plainely as in other places, so especially, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Wee know</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that the Law is spirituall, but I am carnall, sold vnder sinne.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>I know that in mee, that is, in my flesh, there dwelleth no good thing.</hi> And therefore afterward cryeth out, and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon Gods grace and mercy, as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before. And now, if the case thus stood with these holy and excellent men of God, let vs take heed, that none of vs take any conceit, either in regard of our outward estate in the world, or in respect of any learning, wisedome, knowledge, goodnes, godlinesse, or vprightnesse, that wee may peraduenture suppose to be in our selues aboue other men, to flatter, and perswade our owne hearts, as though wee had no need of this change, and alteration of our hearts, minds, and inclinations. For from whence (I pray you) springeth such neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and contempt of Gods Word, as is amongst vs? How is it, that so many men
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2803:74"/> and women are so often, and so easily staid at home from the hearing of it; and so few profit by hearing, when they are present? That there is such vaine swearing, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerent vse of Gods name in the mouths of some? Such prophaning of the Lords day? Such hatred, and heart-burning, malice, and enuy? Such whoredome, drunkennesse, &amp; Alehouse-hunting? Such pride, and vanity? From whence is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, oppression, deceit, lying, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, mocking, backbiting, and the like? Surely the fountaine, and well-spring, from whence all these disorders and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences doe slowe and proceede, is no other but the heart and mind of man remaining in its naturall estate, vnchanged, vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, vnsanctified. And therefore let men flatter themselues as they list, and perswade themselues as they thinke good, that they are sound within, and need not any change from their present condition; that they surely feare God well enough, and are in the state of grace and saluation as well as any other: yet so long as these and such like vnsauoury fruits &amp; effects, are to be seene arising in them, &amp; procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from them: it is as cleere as the

I answere that the Lord God indeed is often angry with his children, as a louing Father, and doth oftentimes seuerely chasten and correct them; but he neuer hateth them. For his loue towards them, being (as you haue heard) perpetuall, and constant: it cannot be, that hee should hate them at any time. Againe, he doth neuer deny them his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but doth shew mercy vnto them after they haue sinned. Hee indueth them also with faith, repentance, and with all other graces of sanctification, freely also pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and forgiueth their sinnes, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them as righteous through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ. All which are eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent arguments, that hee doth not hate them. Loue and friendship among men, if it be true and sincere, is most pleasant: but to be thus beloued of God, and in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with him as his children, is not

For by this loue and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Lord, wee haue communion with Christ, then the which, what can be more sweet and pleasant?

Againe, as I haue shewed before, whom God once receiueth into his loue, he will still loue such a one with vnfained loue, and performe all the parts of a tender Father. And now, as there is no loue or kindnes in the world, so pleasant, so honourable, profitable, or constant, as is the loue of God; so is there none in the world, if it be of any worth, so easie to be obtained. For the Lord neuer denies his loue to any that in sincerity of heart are desirous of it: No, although in many respects, they be vtterly vnworthy to be partakers of it: Vouchsafing it to euery one that beleeueth in Christ, and hath a care and conscience to obey his wil,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2803:78"/> howsoeuer in the manner of obedience, they discouer much infirmitie, and can doe nothing so soundly as he requires. But I will now proceede to another priuiledge and prerogatiue of sonnes.</p>

Now, how a man shall examine himselfe, whether he be the Child of God or no, I haue partly shewed before, and haue often occasion to consider it at large.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2803:87"/> of this deepe mysterie, that two natures remaine in the one person of Christ, a true Diuine, and a true humane nature, (either of them retayning its own disposition, and peculiar properties,) it is euident in the very same places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which haue already beene alledged. As first, where the Prophet <hi>Esay, chap.</hi> 7. saith not only, that <hi>a Virgin shall conceiue, and bring forth a Sonne:</hi> but also addeth, that his name shall be called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> as I haue noted before.

Also in that saying, <hi>Esay</hi> 9. is this apparant: <hi>Vnto vs a child is borne, and vnto vs a Sonne is giuen.</hi> For Christ is giuen, who as concerning his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is from euerlasting, and hee is also borne, hauing his beginning and being, as touching his manhood in the world.

This therefore must of necessity, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of condemnation, be both belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and acknowledged: And not only so, but that these two natures also, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and humane nature, are so conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vnited, as that they are neither swallowed vp one of another, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounded or mingled together, but so, as the properties of each nature remaine safe, and distinct: And so, as we must worship not two, but one Christ, true God, and true man, as touching his Diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the same substance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as touching his humane nature, of the same substance with vs, alwayes except sinne. This is the summe of that which shall be necessary to be considered in this place, that the one of Christes two natures, is eternall, and without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the other a created nature, hauing beginning; the one impassible, the other subiect to infirmities; the one Almighty,

                        <hi>Luke</hi> 1.31, 34, 35.</note>
                     <hi>and said vnto her: The Holy Ghost shall come vpon thee, and the power of the Highest shall ouershaddow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be borne of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</hi> Thus the points beeing cleere and manifest, that there are two natures in Christ, a Diuine, &amp; a humane nature: Secondly, although there be two natures in Christ; yet there is but one person: and thirdly, that this vnion of both natures in one person, was made after a wonderfull manner: Now let vs come to the vses.</p>
                  <p>By this which hath been spoken, wee may see, that there is a double considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be had of Christs Diuinity: the one more secret and hid, as concerning his substance and being: as how hee is of the Father, how coeternall, and consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall with him; how like vnto him in all things, equall in wisedome, power, and euery vertue: And againe, how so begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him, as that there is no separation
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2803:89"/> of Essence. For this (by the way) is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be vnderstood, that whereas hee is said in the Scripture, to be begotten of the Father, and to come from the Father into this world: it must not so bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as though by being begotten, or by his comming from his Father, hee were separated from him: For howsoeuer it be so with vs, and that we are subiect to such diuisions, and separations: yet is it farre otherwise with God, and his Word, and onely Sonne, so as that his eternall Son, neither by being begotten, nor by any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth is separated from the Father; euen as neither the brightnesse in passing from the Sunne, is separated from the Sunne; nor the heat in ascending from the Fire, is separated from the Fire; nor the counsell or wisdome of the heart in a wise man, is separated from the man in giuing good counsell, or in performing any wise or godly action.</p>
                  <p>The other consideration of Christs Diuinity, is more plaine, and apparant, appertaining to his workes and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, whereby his Maiesty (which would otherwise remaine vnknowne, not onely to vs mortall men, but euen also to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2803:90"/> the very Angels themselues, and heauenly spirits) doth now brightly shine, and shew it selfe. In the first of these, the Holy Ghost in the Scripture, is briefe, and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; but in the other, large and ample.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2803:101"/> kindled against our sinnes, the guiltinesse whereof he had so taken vpon him, that he was of necessity to sustaine, whatsoeuer the extremity of their haynousnesse had deserued. From hence procéeded his feare, <label type="milestone">

What comparison can there bee betwixt that which hath an end, and that which hath no end? The wrath of God is endlesse, the strength of man, in respect thereof, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly nothing at all; infinitely and to far too weake for the Maiestie of God. This so great wrath of God, did our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ féele sensibly and indéede, in his whole humanity, both in soule and body. For we must not thinke that bodily death it selfe, could so haue terrified the Sonne of God, if he had not séene and considered, that hee was to vndergoe the wrath and iudgement of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre did it please our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ to humble and abase himselfe for our sakes, and by such humiliation and sufferings, to performe the part and office of a perfect Sauiour and Redéemer. Of all which there was so great necessity,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2803:101"/> that without the same, the mysterie of our saluation could not possibly haue béene fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>If hee had not suffered these anguishes <label type="milestone">

If hee had suffered but onely in body, he should haue béene the Redéemer and Sauiour on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our bodies: It was of necessity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that our Sauiour and Redéemer should both in body and soule sustaine the curse and punishment due vnto our sins, that so through Faith in his redemption, we might both in body and soule be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally blessed. This was the cause of his humiliation and sufferings, yea of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he endured both in soule and body. Wherefore hee became our high Priest, and made himselfe an offering and a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for sin, yea such a sacrifice, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the very curse of God was ioyned: As <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, the truth of this point directly <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> tendeth to the confutation of the Papists, who, besides the alone Passion and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Christ, most grossely and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly maintaine workes of satisfaction; partly of their owne, and partly of the Saints departed, which they adde to the Passion of Christ, as though that alone were not sufficient, cleane contrary to the many testimonies of the Scripture which haue beene remembred. And whereas they also blasphemously affirme, that in Christ we haue forgiuenesse of the fault, but not of the punishment: they manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spurne against the Word of God, which plainely teacheth, that Christ is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, Redeemer, and Aduocate; who hath deliuered vs, not onely from part of our sinnes, but from all our sins; not onely from part of the punishment, which our sinnes had deserued, but also from euery part thereof, as we haue seene sufficiently proued in that which goeth before. And
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2803:106"/> indeed, it should otherwise greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the wisedome of God, if hee should send downe his Sonne, the second person in the Trinity, into this vale of misery, heere to take our flesh, &amp; in the forme of a Seruant, and abiect man, to suffer a most vile and reprochfull death, and all to bee in the end but a party-Redeemer, and a party-Sauiour, and to yéeld a great part of the glory and honour thereof vnto another. No, no, he is God, he giueth not his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto others. He onely (onely hee, I say) is our full, and perfect Reconciler and Redeemer, and all the residue that I haue spoken of before. This is the doctrine of the glorious Gospell of Christ, which we teach, beleeue, and professe: this is no new doctrine, but that which was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the bosome of Gods wisedome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the world.</p>

So often (I say) as we remember the humiliation and sufferings

                  <p>A Sacrament, as you haue heard, is a publike worke of the Church, wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise two notes. First, that in the peace and liberty of the Gospell, Sacraments should bee celebrated publikely in the Church, and in the congregation of Gods people, being assembled together to that end. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, not by priuate men, much lesse by women; but by the publike Minister law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully authorized thereunto.

And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords Supper, it appeareth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33, 34.</note> how the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> very sharpely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they stayed not one for another, and because they made no difference betwéene their priuate houses, and the Church of God.</p>

                  <p>Baptisme, the outward signe is Water, and the washing therewith visible, which is done by the Minister; so the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, is regeneration; that is to say, the bloud of Christ, whereby wee are washed from our sinnes. Likewise in the Lords Supper, the outward signe is Bread and Wine, taken from things commonly vsed for meat and drinke; the thing signified, is the body of Christ crucified, and his bloud shed for our sinnes. Water, Bread, and Wine, considered in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and out of this holy vse, and institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, are onely that which they are called, and said to be; but let the Word of God be once added vnto them, together with calling vpon his holy Name, for their sanctification, according to Christs institution: and then become they holy signes, and representations of all these spirituall and heauenly graces: Neither thenceforth are they to be called bare wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or bare Bread and Wine: but in this holy vse, they beare y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> names of the things signified, as sacramentally ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Ioyned, I say, or vnited by a mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call signification, and by the purpose and will of him who first instituted them. And
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2803:120"/> Christ that instituted Water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, did not institute it with that minde and purpose, that the faithfull should only be dipped in it, or washed with it: And so likewise in the Supper, when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Bread to bee eaten, and the Wine to be drunke; he did not meane that they should onely receiue Bread &amp; Wine, without any further mystery, as they eat and drinke in their houses: but that they should spiritually bee partakers of the things signified, and by Faith bee truely purged from their sinnes, and made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see, whereof Sacraments consist, and how rightly the promises of God, concerning the free forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and euerlasting life, are firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by them, and sealed vp in our hearts. As Circumcision in the old time was profitable to all such as were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized, hauing faith before, and being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the Couenant, a seale of righteousnesse and iustification, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom</hi> 4.11.</note> teacheth of <hi>Abraham;</hi> so is the very same to be said and concluded, as touching the Sacraments that are now in vse. Vnto all such as are within the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2803:121"/> of Gods grace, &amp; mercy in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, &amp; haue true faith in his righteousnesse and redemption, the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme sealeth to their consciences, the washing away of the filthinesse of their sinnes, by the bloud of Christ; so as they are become pure, holy, and vndefiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of God. And the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sealeth vnto them the vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of Christs Death and Passion, to their effectuall preseruation to eternall life. But on the contrary, as Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing profited those that were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, if before they had not faith, and were not comprehended within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant: euen so standeth the case with all those that are not at this day within the Couenant of Gods grace, and mercy in Christ Iesus, &amp; are destitute of true faith in his righteousnesse, and bloud-shedding, though they haue been baptized; yet it is, as if they had neuer been baptized: though they neuer so often partake the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, yet doth it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing profit thom, but they remaine neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, in the state of condemnation.</p>

                  <head>To what ends Sacraments were ordained.</head>
                  <p>A maine cause and end of Sacraments, is to confirme and seale vp in our hearts, the promises of God, concerning the free forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, as is expressed in the definition, and as wee haue already obserued in the former branch. But besides this, there are some others.</p>
                  <p>A second cause wherefore Christs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was to ordaine Sacraments in his Church, is partly our owne infirmity and weakenesse, being dull and slow in the vnderstanding of heauenly things; and partly, the great goodnes and loue of God, that would vouchsafe to attemper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to our rude capacity, and to seeke meanes by outward things, to ease &amp; helpe the same. Our sences also, by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the Sacraments, are stirred vp to be instruments to helpe our minde and weake Faith. Our memory, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by the same means is much strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And therefore a third cause and end of a Sacrament is, that it may be vnto vs a blessed exercise, whereby wee call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2803:122"/> the benefit of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Christ, and yeeld vnto him most hearty praise and thankes for the same, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words of Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19</note>
                     <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee.</hi> And as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16.</note>
                     <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drinke this cup of the Lord, ye shall shew forth his death vnto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</hi> Another cause and end of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is, that by the practics and vse of them, wee might openly before God and the world, protest and acknowledge that we are his people, and of the number of them that looke to be saued, preserued, and defended by the benefit of Christ onely. So that the open vse of the Sacraments, is a part of that confession, whereunto the Apostle doth attribute saluation, when he saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 9.</note>
                     <hi>If thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and beleeue in thy heart, that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saued: For by the heart we beleeue to righteousnesse, and with the mouth confession is made to saluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fourth cause and end of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is, that they might bee as bands and linkes of loue, vnity, and concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selues. All Christians weare
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2803:122"/> one cognizance or Liuery; for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the markes of Christs sheepe. Therefore not to loue, and agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a reproch wrought to our Lord and Master: whereby, in a manner, wee protest to the world that wee bee not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of his Family. <hi>For in this</hi> (saith he, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.35.</note>) <hi>shall all men know you to bee my Disciples, if you loue one another.</hi> Hereof, I say, doth the right vse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Sacraments, very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably put vs in remembrance; wee being taught in Baptisme, that wee are all new borne, Children of God, and grafted into one body: And in the Lords Supper, that wee are fed and nourished with one heauenly food of the body and bloud of Christ: and that therefore we should with faithfull loue, heartily imbrace one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the children of one Father, the members of one body, and as the seruants of one Master, fed at one table, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished with one food to eternall life. And the last cause and end of a Sacrament that I meane now to speak of, is, that by them, as by blessed instruments of the Holy Ghosts working, hee might impart vnto vs, and bestow vpon vs all the fruits and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2803:123"/> benefits of our Redemption in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. For as his Word is, so are his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments instruments, and meanes by the working of his holy Spirit, to bring vnto vs the whole benefit of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now for some vses:</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> Seeing Christ is the Author of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, it cleerely then followeth, that the institution and ordinance of Christ, is the onely true rule and platforme for the right administration and vse of them.

Whereas on the contrary, if the institution of Christ be not inuiolably retained, and preserued, but corrupted, and violated, it is vnpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the vse of the Sacraments, to haue any of these comfortable effects ensuing, to the glory of God, and to the true peace and ioy of our owne soules. This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly taught by the Apostle. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. where labouring to induce the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to the right vse os y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lords Supper, he

                     <hi>I haue receiued of the Lord</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that which I haue deliuered vnto you.</hi> And surely this course did hee there take, not without great wisedome: for if he had barely deliuered his owne opinion, or censured them according to his owne iudgement, they might haue excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and haue beene at choise, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would haue submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thereunto or no: but now seeing he exhorted them vnto nothing, but what Christ himselfe had instituted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be obserued, this tooke from them all excuse, and so as without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest wickednes, they could not deny obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accordingly. After this manner also, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 19.8</note> haue we the example of our Lord Iesus Christ himselfe, who when the Iewes obiected vnto him their custome, and the permission of <hi>Moses,</hi> in giuing them liberty to put away their wiues for euery cause: hee maketh thereunto this answere, <hi>From the beginning</hi> (saith he) <hi>it was not so.</hi> Thus calling them backe to the first institution, and plainely shewing, that whatsoeuer was either practised, or

                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:2803:124"/> they make it a sacrifice propitiatory for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon marchandize to buy soules out of Purgatory, a perpetuall matter of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by leading the people in their eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to worship the creature, in stead of the Creator, no one of all which they haue receiued from Christ: In prophaning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and abusing the other Sacrament of Baptisme, with their salt, breathing, spet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, crossing, anointing; attributing to euery of these the selfe-same operation, that in truth belongeth onely to the holy Ghost. Euen so, it teacheth vs, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ is the Author of Sacraments, that therefore in the feare of God, we doe not lightly esteeme of them, neither think them to be idle ceremonies, vaine trifles, or mens deuices, so as we may vse them, or not vse them, frequent them, or not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent them at our pleasure, and as wee thinke good, but esteeme them as Gods holy ordinances, and alwayes receiue them as at Christes owne hand. For euen as when we heare the Word preached by a mortall man, wee must not receiue it as mans word, but as it is indeed the Word of God, as the Apostle speaketh, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.13.</note>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:2803:125"/> so in the administration &amp; vse of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, wee must not so much regard the Minister, as with the eye of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hand of God, communicating vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the notable effects represented by them: Contrary to the errour of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, who affirme the Sacraments to be of the lesse value, if they be administred by an euill and wicked man. Indeede, the hand of the receiuer being without Faith, makes the Sacraments (which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues be good) to be vnto him of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, because of his vnbeliefe: but an euill Minister cannot make voyde the faith of a godly receiuer. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a wicked and false hypocrite all the time that hee follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed Christ; and yet I doubt not, but the baptisme which he administred, was as auaileable to the faithfull receiuer, as the baptisme of <hi>Peter,</hi> or of any other the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. And this must needes be a notable comfort to all Gods Children, that if they come to the partaking of the Sacraments, furnished with faith and true repentance; whether the Minister be good or bad, yet they shall not be disappointed of the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruits and effects, signified by the same. And as the goodnesse of the Sacraments
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2803:125"/> dependeth not vpon the worthines or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines of the Ministers, so also must they not be weighed by the condition of the receiuers, their goodnes depending onely vpon the faithfulnes, truth, &amp; meere goodnes of GOD; and they continuing true and perfect Sacraments, wherein God offereth the things signified, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the vnbeleeuers be nothing bettered by them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, although the Sacraments be <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> ordayned of God, for notable seales and pledges of his loue and fauour towards vs in Christ Iesus, &amp; as excellent meanes and instruments to confirme, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith in his righteousnes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, of which wee haue continuall need: yet is not saluation tyed vnto them, but onely to faith: So that if a man doe truly beleeue, though he can neuer receiue the Sacraments, yet he shall be saued: but if he doe not truly beleeue, though hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacraments neuer so often, yet is he vtterly excluded from all hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And this doth the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> manifestly teach, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.30.</note> in ascribing iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, (whether a man be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or vncircumcised) onely to faith. If a

So excellent a gift and grace is faith, and so notable a priuiledge and prerogatiue to be endued therewith: And so fearefull a sinne on the other side is vnbeliefe, thus making an annullity, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sort, of Gods wholsome and holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which he hath instituted and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, for the good and saluation of his people. Not that hereupon it followeth, that it is a matter of no moment, whether we partake the Sacraments or no. God forbid. For, as I haue shewed, they are of Christs institution, and that for seales and pledges of his speciall loue and fauour. They are not superfluous therefore, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it a matter indifferent whether they be celebrated or no; but this is that which in this place I note, that saluation is not tyed vnto them, but onely to faith
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2803:126"/> in Christ Iesus, and that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for the want of them, but for the neglect and contempt of them: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding also as neuer in times past were the sacrifices, Sacraments, and ceremonies of the Law, of any account before God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were of his owne ordinance, but onely so farre foorth, as Faith in the Messiah to come, was duly respected, and together ioyned in the obseruation of them: As this might be made appeare by plentifull testimonies and examples.</p>
                  <p>The Papists, cleane contrary to this, doe hold and affirme, that the grace of God, and the thing signified in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are so tyed, and included in the outward signes, that whosoeuer doth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly receiue the signes, must néedes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly participate of the grace of God, and of the thing signified, although the parties be neuer so wicked. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith there is neither iustification nor saluation: Neither doe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of themselues, helpe any whit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. The Forefathers of those Iewes with whom Christ disputed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.31.</note> did eate <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wildernes, after their comming from Egypt, which <hi>Manna</hi> was
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2803:127"/> a type, and figure of Christ, and euen a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrament of his flesh, but yet (as the Apostle teacheth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.</note>) <hi>with many of them God was not pleased, for hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw them in the Wildernesse.</hi> Although they had the Law, the ceremonies and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices among them, daily heard the one, and were often conuersant in the other, yet were they neuerthelesse most wicked and vngodly: by their idolatry and other abominations, most fearefully prouoking the heauy wrath, and iudgements of God against them. <hi>Ananias</hi> and his wife (as <hi>Acts</hi> 5.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3.</note>) had béene baptized, and had also (no doubt) receiued the Lords Supper, and yet did they continue in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and lyes against the holy Ghost: the Sacraments did neither take away their sinnes, nor giue them any iustifying or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace. This wee sée also in <hi>Iudas,</hi> and in <hi>Simon Magus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as by this which hath already béen spoken, this is a cleare and manifest truth, that the Sacraments cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay grace, neither iustifie, nor make men righteous of themselues, as the Papists very grosly doe affirme; so is it withall as cleare and euident, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2803:127"/> haue no power to pardon or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue sinnes. Contrary also to their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, that by Baptisme is washed away that originall sinne, wherein wee are conceiued and borne, and that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hath spred from <hi>Adam,</hi> vpon all mankinde, and that thereby wee are restored to that same righteousnes, and purenesse of nature, which <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall.

In which respect, very much deceiued was the Apostle; if the Papists say true, that by Baptisme, originall sinne is washed away. Againe, if this were so, it is then vnpossible that any beeing baptized should sinne: For originall sinne is the ground of all sinne: take this away, and then can wee not commit any sinne: For if the well-spring be stopped, no streames can issue: or if the foundation be razed, it is not possible that the building should stand.</p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:2803:128"/>
                  <p>It is no small errour of theirs also, to hold, as they doe, that the Sacraments can purge from actuall sinnes, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punishments, as sicknes, and the like. As in the time of Popery, it was an vsual thing, when any man was sicke, to haue the Sacrament (as they called it) carried vnto him, thus making it a charme for all diseases. In which blinde and grosse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, many remaine at this day so mis-led, that when God punisheth them for their sinne, either by sicknes, or otherwise, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be neuer so void of faith and repentance; yet if they may haue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, they perswade themselues that all is well.</p>
                  <p>Now in this discouery of popish er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as touching the Sacraments, wee diminish nothing of the worthinesse, and excellency of them (as they falsely lay to our charge,) but restore them, and labour to preserue them, according to the end and purpose of the Lord in their institution: which was, that they should be, not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of grace, or causes of righteousnes, but seales of righteousnes, and of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of Faith, as the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</note> yea, not of any other, but of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2803:128"/> that righteousnesse of Faith which is had and obtained before the receiuing of them.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, seeing the Sacraments <label type="milestone">

That therefore with humble hearts, wee bee religiously carefull to yéeld immortall thankes to the Eternall God in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesus Christ, for that he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed so graciously, and mercifully to haue consideration of our infirmity, to help our frailty; and, as it were, to lead vs like children by the hand, and appoint vs w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THis I néed not stand much vpon, it being plaine by that which hath already beene shewed; that there can be but two Sacraments of the New Testament ordained by Christ to confirm our hearts in the assurance of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to eternall life; namely, Baptisme, and the Lords Supper. No other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signes, obseruations, or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies tending to this confirmation, but onely these two. And whereas the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists say, that besides these there are fiue other; Confirmation, Penance, extreme Vnction, Order and Wedlocke; in which (as they say) vnder the couer of visible things, the power of God worketh mans

For vnto euery Sacrament (as you haue heard) and (speaking properly of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) there must bee a sensible outward signe, and the word of institution. Now these fiue which they call Sacraments, do want either the Word, or the outward signe, or else both of them together. As for example: Matrimonie, Order, and Penance, as they terme them, haue in some sence, the Word of God to approoue them; but they haue no outward element, or creature ioyned therewith. Extreme Vnction, and Confirmation, haue neither outward creature, nor any Word of God to warrant them. And therefore if these fiue be to bee accounted Sacraments, it will be a very easie matter to proue many more.</p>

                  <p>And whereas it hath been held &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as a lawfull action, that Midwiues (in the time of necessity (as they call it) and when the Child is likely to dye, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conueniently bee brought to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ministery) may baptize. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Ministers outward washing with water in Baptisme, is a most certaine signe, seale and pledge, of the inward washing, whereby wee are clensed from our sinnes by the bloud of Christ.

For to bee baptized in the name of Christ, is to be enrolled (as it were) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and receiued into the couenant, and family, and so into the inheritance of the Sonnes of God, to be purged also from the filth of sinne, and to be endued with the manifold graces of God, for the glorifying of his Maiesty in an innocent life. As they then who delight in sinne, and follow the lusts and motions of the flesh, doe sinne against the nature of Baptisme, so do they also violate, and breake the couenant made betwixt God and them: Yea, hereby are

               <p>Answ. <hi>The Supper of the Lord, is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament instituted by our Lord Iesus Christ: whereby it is signified, and sealed vnto vs, that we are as assuredly sustained to eternall life, by the body of Christ crucified, and by his bloud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shed, as we certainely eate the broken bread, at the Lords Table, and drinke the wine out of the Cup,</hi> Math. 26, 26, 27. 1.

                  <p>THat you may the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this Doctrine of the Lords Supper, and come prepared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, with the more reuerence and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: (after I haue spoken a few words of the time, when it was instituted,) I wil enter into a briefe, and particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and explication of the words of Christs institution, together with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall circumstances, or sacramental acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they are recorded by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2803:139"/> and the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the time of the institution, <hi>The Lord Iesus</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>in the night that hee was betrayed, tooke bread.</hi> From this circumstance of time, wee are to obserue two points. First, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, is succée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the place of the Sacrament of the Iewes Passeouer, which was instituted by God, a little before the deliuerance of the Israelites frō the captiuity of Egypt: euen as this was instituted by our Lord Iesus Christ, a little before our actuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from the thraldome and captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sinne, Satan, death, and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of which our spirituall deliuerance, from these deadly enemies of our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Sacrament of the Passeouer was a type, and figure, and therefore not yet abolished, as touching the substance, but that remayning whole, and entire in the Lords Supper: the difference of time on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted, as I haue shewed before. Now the reason, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>
                     </label> wherefore he instituted this Sacrament in the night, was this, forasmuch as he was thereunto compelled by the necessity of the Law of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was expresly cōmanded, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2803:140"/> that the Passeouer should be celebrated at euen.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.6.</note> The which ordinance of God was first by him to be fulfilled, before he might proceed to the abolishing thereof, by the institution of any other. So that hereupon it followeth not, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper must still be administred in the night, because Christ in making himselfe subiect to the Law, instituted the same at that season: but this hereupon we may warrantably conclude, that it may be administred in the night, and after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per too, if vrgent occasion and necessitie require the same, as in the time of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Papists contend, that it standeth with no reason, to call this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by the name of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, because it was instituted after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: they cauell herein, not onely against vs, but euen against the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who in plaine expresse words so termeth it in the twentieth Verse of the same Chapter.</p>
                  <p>For a second note, heere is offered vnto vs a most notable consideration of Christs wonderfull loue and goodnesse towards vs: For euen as when a man thinking
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2803:140"/> on death, and preparing himselfe to leaue this world, doth in his last Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament bequeath some gift or Legacy vnto his friends, to such as haue beene néere and deare vnto him, whereby they might haue occasion to remember him, and to praise GOD for him when hee is gone: So our Lord Iesus Christ, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now the houre to be at hand, wherein he should by death leaue this world, and ascend vnto his heauenly Father, hath in the institution of this Sacrament, left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs a most excellent pledge and token of his tender loue and kindnes towards vs, not onely in abasing himselfe to take our flesh; but also in suffering death for our Redemption. This was no small loue, but a loue most wonderful surpassing and excellent; of which himselfe speaketh, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Greater loue then this hath no man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.13.</note>
                     <hi>when any man bestoweth his life for his friends.</hi> And now, as all the parts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of this loue, our Lord Iesus Christ performed in his life, and at his death: euen so, hath hee left vnto vs this Sacrament, for a memoriall thereof, and perpetually to that end to bee obserued, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vntill his comming againe. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2803:141"/> in regard hereof, there could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fitter time for the celebration of the same, then in the same night wherein hee was betrayed, and when hee certainely knew, that he should shortly dye, that so it might the more freshly bee imprinted and retained in our mindes.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>He tooke bread:</head>
                  <p>The bread which Christ tooke, was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread: the same being the vsuall and ordinary bread at that time. And whereas the Papists say, that because Christ tooke vnleauened bread, the first part of this Sacrament must alwayes therefore be administred with bread that is not leauened, and that it is an abuse of of Christs ordinance, if it bee administred with that which is leauened: The answer is plaine, that the necessitie of the time constrained Christ to take vnleauened bread, it being an ordinance and Law of God, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exo.</hi> 12.15.</note> that for the space of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen dayes there should be no leuen found
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2803:142"/> in the houses of the children of Israel, and that whosoeuer should eat leauened bread from the first day, vntill the seuenth, that person should be cut off from Israel. And now when Christ instituted this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and tooke Bread, it was the first of these seuen, as we may see, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 26.17.</note> So then, hereupon it followeth not, as they imagine, that this part of the Sacrament must of necessity be administred with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread: but this may well be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and concluded, that it must euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more be administred with bread, and that whosoeuer shall presume to celebrate it with any thing else, hee retaineth not the institution of Christ; but is manifestly guilty of prophaning &amp; abusing the same: the Euangelist saying in plaine termes, that he tooke bread: and they name no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that he tooke; neither also doth the Apostle say, that he instituted it with any thing else. And surely, herein is a more manifest argument of Christs loue, then is of euery one well considered; in that, by such familiar creatures, as Bread and Wine, he would vouchsafe to attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per himselfe to our rude capacity, and to bring vs to the perfect vnderstanding of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2803:142"/> his heauenly mysteries: wee being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by plainely taught, and led (as it were) by the hand, to this comfortable assurance; that as Bread and Wine by naturall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, nourish our bodies, strengthen and comfort our spirits: so doth the body and bloud of Christ broken, and shed for vs vpon the Crosse, nourish our soules, and quicken our spirits to eternall life with God. As the bread is made of many graines kneaded into one loafe; and the Wine pressed out of many Grapes into one Cup: so the multitude of Christians, communicating at the Lords Table, though many in number, are ingrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, and made members of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall body, and ioyned with mutuall loue one with the other, so that now they liue by the Spirit of Christ, as members of a naturall body liue, and haue sence by that Spirit, that commeth from the heart, and from the head.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>He gaue thankes.</head>
                  <p>The forme &amp; matter of Christs thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, is expressed neither by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> nor by any of the Euangelists, they all concealing it, and (no doubt) vpon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:2803:143"/> great consideration. But whatsoeuer it was, this is manifest, that thereby he san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and separated the Bread, to bee an holy and blessed Sacrament of his body, broken for vs vpon the Crosse; as also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the Wine, to be an holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his bloud shed for our sinnes. Whereby we learne two points. First, somewhat generally by conference with other places: That we ought to giue God thankes in the vse of his good creatures, and to pray him to blesse and sanctify them to our comfort: remembring this notable saying of the Apostle,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5.</note> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>Euery creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be receiued with thanksgiuing, &amp;c.</hi> The second, and more particular, is, that by praise &amp; thanksgiuing vnto God, for the death of Christ, and by prayer vnto him, that we may bee made partakers of the fruit and benefit of his Death, ought the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be administred, and the Bread and Wine sanctified, and set apart to that end.</p>
                  <p>The Papists terme this thanksgiuing, consecration: which phrase, and terme of speech, we would not stand vpon, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2803:143"/> they did not teach, that by consecration, the very substance of the Bread &amp; Wine, should be turned into the body &amp; bloud of Christ: which is nothing so. For conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration is, when that thing which before was impure, and that creature which was common, or vncleane, is made pure, and set apart, for the vse of man. And this is two wayes. First, they are sanctified of the Lord; and secondly, they are sanctified of vs. The creatures are said to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated of the Lord, when they are insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, ordained, and set apart from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, to serue for the vse of man, by his holy Word, according to that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which I noted before; and where he addeth, that it is sanctified by the Word and Prayer. The second manner of consecration which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to vs, is by giuing of thankes. And thus, and no otherwise, is the Bread and Wine at the Lords Table, to bee conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated at this day, and from time to time. It is consecrated and set apart, by the Word and institution of Christ; and by the prayer, praise, and thanksgiuing of the Minister, and faithfull Christians, in the celebration, and participation thereof,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2803:144"/> comming (as they ought to come) prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereunto, with a religious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wonderfull and vnspeakeable mercy and louing kindnesse of the Lord, <hi>who spared not his owne Sonne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</note>
                     <hi>but gaue him to death for vs all,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>He brake the Bread.</head>
                  <p>From hence we learne, that the Bread at the Lords Table, in the administration of the Sacrament, must be broken. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is according to Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we sée héere in expresse termes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that euery one of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants feeding thereon equally, may see themselues to be equally partakers of the body of Christ crucified; yea, this brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bread seemeth so necessary, that the Holy Ghost doth call the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by that very terme,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>Cha.</hi> 20.7.</note>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>chap.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>And a third reason is, because this brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Bread, doth most liuely set forth vnto vs, the breaking of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for our sinnes. Not that his body was materially broken,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.36. <hi>Exo.</hi> 12.46.</note> as wee reade <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. (for the outward breaking of it could haue made no satisfaction,) but
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2803:144"/> the breaking was inward, in Spirit, with bearing the burthen of our sinnes, with which inward griefe of the Spirit, the body, in some sort, may also be said to bee broken, or tormented, when therein, for the bitternesse of the paine, he cryed vnto his Father, as it is recorded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. and 27.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.36 <hi>chap.</hi> 27.46</note> So then, when wee see the bread broken before vs in the Sacrament, we must ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeue, that the body of Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is offered vnto vs of our heauenly Father, to be receiued by Faith.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>He gaue the Bread.</head>
                  <p>As the bread at the Lords Table must be broken; so also giuen and distributed. If it bee taken into the hand of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, sanctified by prayer and thanksgiuing and broken; yet if withall it be not distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, it is no Sacrament, nor sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bread, that bread onely, being so to bée termed, and accounted, which is after prayer and thanksgiuing broken, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed to the communicants. Which quite ouerthroweth the opinion and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Papists, in keeping the bread in their boxes, which remaineth vndistri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, as most holy, &amp; consecrated bread,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2803:145"/> thinking, and making the simple people beleeue, that that bread hath maruellous great vertue in it, to driue away Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, &amp;c. which is not worth the standing vpon.</p>
                  <p>That which the distributing of the bread doth signifie vnto vs, is, that it is not the body of Christ, as it was borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that is offered vnto vs, or represented by the bread; but his body as it is was broken, by which wee are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And secondly, that this Sacrament must be administred in the face of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and publikely to all the people, being assembled together for the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it: Contrary also to another cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Papists; the Priest often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times receiuing it alone, as wee shall sée further hereafter.</p>
                  <p>And whereas hee gaue the bread vnto his Disciples; we may learne &amp; obserue, that such onely are meet partakers of the Lords Supper, who are the Schollers and Disciples of Christ. And of Christs Disciples doth hee himselfe make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,<note place="margin">

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:2803:145"/> they presume to come to the Table of the Lord, are religiously carefull, to proue and examine themselues.</p>

                  <p>The Bread at the Lords Table, being blessed, broken, and distributed, must also be receiued, and eaten. If it be sanctified, broken, and distributed, and therewithall not receiued, and eaten, it is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor sacramentall bread. The bread being set apart by prayer, and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, broken, giuen, receiued, and eaten, is an holy Sacrament of the body of Christ; and they who reuerently, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously, according to Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are partakers thereof; doe together, with the bodily eating of the bread, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and by faith, eate, and receiue the very body of Christ, to the spirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment and preseruation of their soules.</p>

                     <hi>This</hi> expresseth the matter of the first part of the Sacrament, as I shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: The word <hi>(this:)</hi> which sentence is to be applyed vnto the bread, which the Minister doth take blesse, breake, and giue
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2803:146"/> to the communicants, exhorting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to receiue, and eate it. And whereas hauing thus relation vnto the bread, he saith, <hi>This is my body:</hi> Wee must not thinke, that the pronouncing of these words doth make the Sacrament, or is any part of the consecration, as the Papists imagine: but herein did our Lord Iesus Christ teach his Disciples, what hee had done, and how hee had sanctified and set apart the bread, to be an holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of his body, which should shortly bee broken and crucified for them.</p>
                  <p>That which wee obserue heere for our instruction and comfort, is this: That the bread at the Lords Table, taken, blessed, broken, giuen, receiued and eaten, is a most holy Sacrament, and representation of the body of Christ crucified, and broken for vs in the Garden, and vpon the crosse. And whereas our Lord Iesus Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it his body; I will shew some reasons wherefore he doth so, and then come to a further proofe of this point, by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies &amp; authorities of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>A first reason why hee called this bread his Body, was, to teach his Disciples to make a difference betwixt this sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2803:146"/> Bread, and common bread.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to distinguish it from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Sacrament, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the Cup.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to distinguish it from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Old Testament.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to teach his Disciples the thing signified by that outward Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therewithall the inseparable coniunction betweene the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the thing thereby signified in the right receiuing of it.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, that his Disciples should know, that hee had instituted an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Sacrament of the New Testament, besides Baptisme: and which they might well discerne, not onely in that hee tooke common bread, blessed it, brake it, and gaue it to them, commanding them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and eate it: but in that also he gaue it the name of the thing thereby signified, according to the vsual phrase of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when it speaketh of Sacraments, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11.</note> Circumcision being but the signe of the Couenant, is called the Couenant. And <hi>Exodus</hi> 12.<note place="margin">

                  <p>But heere a question may bee asked; that seeing as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4.</note> we be grafted into Christs Death and Resurrection by Baptisme: what neede haue wee then of this Sacrament? or how doth it differ from that? Whereunto I answere, that this Sacrament doth not differ from Baptisme, but in the manner and institution of it. For as Baptisme was instituted to ingraft vs into Christs body, that wee might become his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: So the Lords Supper was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ordained to nourish vs, to retaine and to feed vs, being ingrasted into his body, and that so we might grow and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in him.</p>
                  <p>Another question may be asked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same that is offered vnto vs in the Sacraments, be not in like manner offered vnto vs in the Ministery and preaching of the word of God? To this I answere, that Christ by the Word, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to our eares outwardly, but in the Sacraments he is receiued of vs inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2803:147"/> by faith into our soules: So that wee become one with him, and he one with vs, and dwelleth in vs, euen vntill the end of the world, and that without any sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                  <p>The Papists would haue these words to be applyed to their Priests, who (as they say) are to offer vp the body and bloud of Christ, a sacrifice for sinne. But marke it well, and you shall see into what absurdities they run. For if these words, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee,</hi> be to be applyed onely to the Priests, then must none but onely the Priests remember Christs death: the which I say is most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd; all the faithfull Communicants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religiously and faithfully to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Christ, as well as they.</p>
                  <p>And as for that which they say of the Priests offering of Christs body for a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: it is most cleare, that the elect and faithfull, being made perfect by the onely oblation of Christ offered by himselfe once for all, as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 14.18.</note> neede no other sacrifice, but a memoriall, and Sacrament thereof, to confirme their
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:2803:148"/> faith in the remission of sinnes purchased by his sacrifice, according as hereof again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26.</note> that if Christ should be often offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for sinne, then he should often haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: but it is manifest that hee did but once suffer, when he offered himselfe for a sacrifice: therefore is hee not now any more to be offered: as also againe, <hi>cha.</hi> 10. <hi>Where remission of these things is, there is no more offering for sinne.</hi> So then, when Christ said, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> It is as much in effect, as if he should say, Eate this broken bread, and performe all other parts and circumstances of my institution from time to time, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me, and especially of my death, and of the excellent fruites and benefits thereof, to the redemption and saluation of the world, &amp; so consequently with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting praise, and thankes, vnto my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, for his vnspeakeable loue and goodnesse in the same respect. This is the true sence and meaning of these words, and the true end and purpose that Christ aymed at, in the institution of this Sacrament: That his death and passion, and the notable fruits and benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, should not onely be had in perpetuall
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2803:148"/> remembrance of his Church, but also that his exceeding bounty and goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the redemption and saluation of mankinde, should be published with due praise, and aduanced with hearty thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Also he tooke the Cup.</head>
                  <p>In these words the Euangelist comes to the second part of the institution of this Sacrament: wherein, before I come to the particular handling of them, we may obserue two speciall outward differences betweene this Sacrament, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptisme. First, Baptisme is administred in one onely element or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible creature, namely, water: and this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper in two, Bread, and Wine. The other difference is in the vse, the one being taken without the body, and the other within. Now the reason why Baptisme is instituted in one element, and this other Sacrament in two, was, because Christ is signified, and represented in both Sacraments after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sorts. In Baptisme, as hee is the washer away of our sinnes, and giueth vs entrance into his Church, that wee may
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2803:149"/> be partakers of his benefits. And in the Lords supper, as our natural bodies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue with bread alone, nor with drinke only; but we must haue both bread &amp; drink: euen so, our soules cannot be nourished with the body of Christ alone, nor with his bloud onely, but we must of necessity haue both his body &amp; bloud. And therfore, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. he saith, <hi>That his flesh is meate indeede, and his bloud is drinke indeede.</hi> Which is as much as if hee said, That as our bodies are nourished with meate and drinke, so are our soules nourished, and strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the vndoubted hope of eternall life, no otherwise, then onely by faith in his body crucified, and in his bloud shed. For this is a note, very necessary to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the Bread &amp; Wine are not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the body and bloud of Christ, as he is now glorified, but as he was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and crucified for vs vpon the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>That which we call the Cup, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists translate a Chalice: but the Word doth signifie any common and ordinary vessell to drinke in. And it is no great matter in what manner of Cup it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, so as it be comely, the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not delighted with outward shewes.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2803:149"/> And whereas S. <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25</note> make mention of the circumstance of the time when he tooke the Cup, as namely, after Supper, we may thereby know, that there was a distance of time betwixt the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Bread, and of the Wine: For the Bread was giuen when they were at Supper, but not the Wine, vntil they had supped. Whereupon it may be gathered, that it is not of necessity, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, in the administration of the Lords Supper, should giue the Wine presently after the imparting of the Bread: but that there may be some space of time, wherein may be singing of Psalmes, &amp;c. Another thing to be obserued in the taking of the Cup, is, that in the vse of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Wine is as necessary to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of euery Communicant, as is the Bread: for euen as Christ gaue the one, and commanded it to be perpetually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in remembrance of him, euen so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and after the same manner, hee tooke the Cup, gaue it, and instituted the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall obseruation of the same.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>He gaue thankes.</head>
                  <p>We see heere, that there ought to be a double thanksgiuing, in the celebration of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2803:150"/> the Lords Supper: for as Christ gaue thankes when he gaue the Bread, so did he in like manner giue thankes when hee gaue the Cup. The forme and matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here concealed as in the former.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>He gaue it to them.</head>
                  <p>The parties to whom hee gaue the Wine, were his Disciples: vnder the name and title of whom are vnderstood all faithfull Christians generally, vnto whose faith, euen as vnto his Disciples, doth the Lord giue his bloud, as often as they celebrate the Lords Supper, and haue the Wine giuen them in the same. From which Sacramentall action of the Lords giuing the Cup vnto his Disciples, wee may here againe obserue: First, that it is not the bloud of Christ, as it naturally procéeded from the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but his bloud, as it was shed vpō the Crosse, that is giuen vnto vs for our spirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, and whereby we are saued, And secondly, that this Sacrament of the Lords Supper, ought not, without respect of persons, to be administred to euery one, but only vnto such as approue themselues to be Christs Disciples: And who they
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2803:150"/> are, I haue shewed already.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>He said, Drinke ye all of it.</head>
                  <p>From hence wee learne two points. First, that the drinking of the Wine is so necessary to the being of the second part of this Sacrament, as that although it be blessed, giuen, and receiued, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, vnlesse it be drunke, it is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For euen as not the water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, nor the pronouncing of these words after the blessing of it, <hi>I baptize thee in the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> doth make the same Sacrament, vnlesse there be one that is baptized, so neither the blessing, giuing, or receiuing of the Wine, doth make the Sacrament of Christs bloud, vnlesse there be some that do drinke the same. And therefore, how truly the Papists affirme that to be the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they reserue after the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, or rather what horrible idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try they commit in calling, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it for a God, there is none so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant but he may discerne.</p>
                  <p>The second point is, that all they who are partakers of the Bread, which is the Sacrament of Christs body, ought in like
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2803:151"/> manner to be partakers of the Wine, which is the Sacrament of Christs bloud. For, euen as he said concerning the one, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body:</hi> euen so in like manner, concerning the other, <hi>Drinke ye all of it.</hi> Whereupon the Euangelist <hi>Marke, chap.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.23.</note> addeth, that <hi>they all dranke of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alwayes heerewithall being duly obserued, that although there bee two kindes of outward substances, namely, Bread, and Wine, yet doe they both make but one Sacrament, and therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may not be separated. Whereby againe, the grosnesse, or rather the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable presumption of the Papists, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently discouered, in that, of their owne priuate authority, they dare corrupt the holy institution of Christ, offering to the Lay people (as they call them) one onely kinde, namely, the Bread, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; and vtterly denying them to drinke of the Cup. Whereas, the Lord Christ (as it were, by the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie) fore-seeing what should come to passe in the Church, speaketh nothing so generally of the Bread, as of the Cup. Hee saith not of the Bread, Eate ye all of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2803:151"/> this: but, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body:</hi> but of the Cup, without any maner of restraint, <hi>Drinke ye all of this.</hi> Whereupon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27, 28.</note> hauing an especiall regard to this holy ordinance, and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ, doth many times ioyne the Bread and the Cup together, as may be seene at large in that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, if the Sacrament of the bloud of Christ were giuen to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles onely, (as the Papists imagine) then the thing it selfe, namely, remission of sinnes, which is obtained through Christs bloud, belongeth onely vnto them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord plainely saith in the very next words, that not onely for them, but for the remission of the sinnes of many, is his bloud shed: and in many other places it is euident, that his bloud was shed for the redemption of all the faithfull. Wherfore if the thing it selfe, namely, remission of sinnes, belong generally to all that truly beleeue, much more then vndoubtedly ought the signe of the same. But they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that if the Cup be giuen to all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, there may bee a great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed, in letting it fall. As if the eternall prouidence of God could not
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2803:152"/> foresee the danger of committing that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: And as if the Papists were become more carefull, and more prouident to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent offences, then the Sonne of GOD. Againe, they say, that onely the Apostles sate with the Lord at his last Supper, and that the vse of the Cup was granted to them onely, and so consequently, that all the Priests whom the Apostles did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and not any other at this day, should drinke of the Cup: but by as good reason they may say, that the Bread is in like manner to be debarred from the common people, as also from all women generally, seeing it cannot be proued, that any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men sate at table with him when he insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>They also cry out, that one kinde is enough for the Lay people, forasmuch as by a necessary concomitance it followeth, that where the body of Christ is, there is his bloud also: which exclamation of theirs if it be sufficient, then it must needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that one part of this Sacrament was instituted in vaine: But the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly first gaue the Bread, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Wine, and instituted nothing in vaine: therefore both kindes, séeing the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2803:152"/> Lord so commanded, ought to be parted among all the faithfull. If he had meant to signifie both his body and bloud when he gaue the Bread, he would not haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the one from the other, both in words and signes: but being willing to helpe our weakenesse, did set the Cup se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally from the Bread, to teach, that hee sufficeth no lesse for drinke, then for meat. Therefore, although it be true which they pretend, that the bloud is in the Bread, and the body in the Cup, yet they defraud the faithfull of the strength and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, which the Lord in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction hath so carefully and tenderly prouided for them.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>For this is my bloud of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is shed for many for the remission of sinnes.</head>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in rehearsing these words of Christ, doth somewhat differ from the Euangelists <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> but in sence and meaning they be all one, and there is no diuersity at all betwéene them. For séeing they all spake by one Spirit, which is the Spirit of truth, it is vtterly vnpossible, that one should be any
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2803:153"/> thing contrary to the other, or that the one should in any measure at all dissent from the other. <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> reade it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, <hi>This is my bloud of the new Testament, &amp;c.</hi> meaning thereby, that the Wine in the Cup, was a Sacrament of his bloud, by which his bloud, the new Testament, or couenant of frée remission of sinnes, was fully established: for it was neuer fully confirmed, and ratified, before it was confirmed by Christs reall bloud. For the bloud of Calues and Lambs, in the old Testament, were but signes and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Christs bloud. And therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this couenant was made at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, when the Lord said, <hi>The seed of the woman shall breake the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</note> yet was it not fully confirmed and established, before Christs death. But the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> agréeing with the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist <hi>Luke,</hi> repeateth Christs words in this sort: <hi>This Cup is the new Testament in my bloud,</hi> that is, this is a new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new Testament, confirmed in my bloud. So that (as I said) there is no repugnancy: but in sence and meaning they agrée all in one. For as the holy Ghost can shew his minde in all languages, euen
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2803:153"/> so also infinite wayes in one tongue. The Cup is taken for the Wine in the Cup, by a figuratiue kinde of spéech. By a figure also is it said to be the new Testament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary phrase of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vsually attributing (when it spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Sacraments) the name of the thing signified, to the outward signe, as I haue shewed before. The outward signe (I say) is here honoured by the thing signified: so that this herein we are to obserue, that the Wine in the Cup at the Lords Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consecrated, and put apart by prayer and thanksgiuing, is not to be considered as common, and ordinary Wine, but is an holy Sacrament of the new couenant, made between God and vs through Iesus Christ, concerning the free deliuerance from the guiltines of all our sins, and our eternall life, through faith in his bloud. And now for these two respects, is it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely after this manner called the new Testament, not in regard of the matter and substance thereof, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Christ being the substance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was promised at the beginning of the world, but in respect of the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and administration of the same,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2803:154"/> forasmuch, as whereas the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before Christs comming, had this couenant ministred vnto them in types and figures, so as they saw Christ, but as as it were, a farre off: wee now sée him much more liuely and familiarly, being administred vnto vs after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with all his glory and righteousnesse. And secondly, it is called the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or couenant, because it is confirmed vnto vs after a new sort: for it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them of the old Testament, in the bloud of Calues, Lambs, Goates, &amp;c. so farre as it pleased the Lord: but it is confirmed to vs in Christs owne bloud, which for our sakes, for our redemption and saluation, hee shed vpon the Crosse: According as hee said in plaine termes when hee gaue the Wine, that <hi>his bloud was shed for many, for the remission of sinnes.</hi>

                  <head>For many, for the remission of sinnes.</head>
                  <p>Vnder the name of many, hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth all such as are elected, and doe truly beléeue in him, of what Nation, or Countrey, and of what estate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soeuer they be throughout the world.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2803:154"/> Whence we may obserue for our further instruction and comfort. First, Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency: That in no measure at all, in regard of himselfe he deserued death, but for this cause submitted himselfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, that as the Apostle saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>That he might destroy, through death, him that had the power of death, that is, the deuil: and that he might deliuer all them, which for feare of death were all their life time sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto bondage.</hi> In him had the Prince of this world nothing, as himselfe spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.30.</note> because hee was clearely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, and free from all sinne, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">

                        </gap>5.</note> Secondly, that many, but not all, without exception, haue remission of sinnes by Christs death and bloud-shedding. That hee hath not giuen his life a ransome, and shed his bloud, nor by bearing their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, hath iustified all, but many, that is, part of all: which many, are all such as are elected, and truly beleeue in him, as I said before. So saith <hi>Simeon, Luke</hi> 2.<note place="margin">

The death
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2803:155"/> of Christ, in respect of the fulnesse and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of redemption, is sufficient for all men, but it is effectuall onely to those that were fore-ordayned to life in him.

And if they say that the body of Christ crucified, and the merit of his Death, euer goe together in the receiuers of the Sacrament; and that they who receiue the one really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, receiue also the other: then doe they fall into a foule absurdity, and make the distinction of the Apostle idle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 29.</note> that some are worthy, and some are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiuers.

We are in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable case, through want of this sweet and heauenly food, and yet wretched men and women (as we are for the most part) we doe not see nor perceiue it.

An holy Sacrament and representation (I say) of Christs body and bloud, but not the body and bloud of Christ it selfe. For wee must not confound the outward signe, and the thing signified, but their seuerall natures must be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> For if the nature of the parts were vnited, or naturally knit together, either by changing the substance of the Bread, (as the Papists most grosly imagine:) or
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:2803:164"/> by an inseparable concomitance (as the Lutherans professe) then must it needes follow indeede, (as here it is demanded,) that all such as receiue the Sacrament, do in like manner feede vpon Christ to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: that all they which partake of the signes, must of necessity be partakers also of the things signified. Which to hold and beleeue, is most absurd, and statly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the examples and testimonies of the Scripture: For <hi>Simon Magus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the outward signe in Baptisme, but of the thing signified, hee was very farre. And as the Apostle teacheth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. the ancient Fathers before Christs comming, <hi>did eate of the same spirituall meate, and dranke of the same spirituall drinke, &amp;c. but yet with many of them God was not pleased, for he ouerthrew them in the wildernes.</hi> Shall wee say now that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or these Fathers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued together with the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Christ Iesus, and his sauing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thereby represented? Surely if they had God would not haue beene displeased with them, nor depriued them of the sweet and comfortable fruits, and effects therof. The Sacrament is one thing, and the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2803:165"/> thing signified is another thing. The Sacrament is receiued with the hand, it entreth into the mouth, nourisheth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; hath a passage out of the body againe, as other meate and drinke. But the thing signified, which is Christs body &amp; bloud, is not receiued by the hand, but in the heart by faith in Christs death and redemption, as we shal see more fully in the next point. A wicked man, yea a very reprobate, may receiue the Sacrament, and be damned when he hath done, but onely such as are Gods elect, in receiuing the Sacrament, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> doe feede vpon Christ to eternall life. And the reasons are cleare, because our Lord Iesus Christ gaue his flesh to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,<note place="margin">

The Sacrament may be eaten well, and religiously of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and not well, but prophanely, of wicked and vngodly men: But as for the flesh and bloud of Christ it selfe, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eaten and receiued at any time but well, and of the godly alone, &amp; to their life and saluation, according to the expresse words of Christ, which I haue remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2803:166"/> of Christ is said to be eaten, and drunke, in the vse of the Sacrament of both godly and vngodly: but truly spiritually and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede, of the godly alone, and not onely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, as it is of the wicked: The <label type="milestone">

I might produce many other places, wherein the holy Ghost witnesseth, that we haue eternall life by beleeuing in Christ: but the point is plaine enough by Christs owne words, that to beleeue in Christ, is to feede vpon him. Now if any thinke, that this spirituall eating by faith, is but a slight matter, and of no great weight, such men doe not consider the great vertue, power, and strength of faith. For by faith we doe not only know Christ, and the true meanes of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him: but thereby we also receiue Christ, and assure our selues in our hearts, that we are partakers of that redemption, which by his death hee hath procured for vs, and with that firme perswasion lay him vp in the bowels of our hearts, that in all our temptations and troubles, wee may feede vpon him, and gather strength and comfort in the assurance of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour purchased by him: so that so often as our hearts are shaken with mistrust and feare; this faith doth comfort and relieue vs againe.

                  <p>Euen, as when wee are desirous of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily nourishment, wee must come to the partaking of it, where it is to be had: so, for the partaking of Christ Iesus to our spirituall nourishment and saluation, wee must likewise repaire &amp; resort vnto him. For as their bodies cannot be nourished, who come not to the eating of that corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall foode that is prepared for them, no more can their soules be satisfied, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by Christ Iesus crucified, which come not accordingly to the partaking of

                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.37.</note> so, nothing at all profitable is Iesus Christ vnto all such as feele no want of him, through the sence and consideration of their wretched and miserable estate, and therewithall also, are voyde of faith to apprehend and apply his righteousnesse and redemption to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of their sinnes, to their iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eternall life.

                        <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28.</note> and with an humble and penitent

                  <p>This must be the manner of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto Christ at this day, not with such affections, as the Iewes resorted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in times past, some in hypocrisie, some for their bellies, some with a regard onely of his bodily presence, but our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto him must be in truth and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for the good of our soules, and for the partaking of his righteousnesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, according as hee is made vnto <hi>vs of God, wisedome, righteousnes,</hi>

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2803:171"/> that in the Ministery and preaching of the Gospell, is the Lord Iesus especially to be found at this day, and therein most familiarly doth hee reueale and discouer himselfe. And therefore in hearing the same, and in resorting thereunto, must all such as desire to finde Christ, take most paines, and with greatest dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence imploy themselues.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39.</note> Searching the Scriptures also to this end, for a right discerning of the truth, and praying vnto God for the assistance of his grace in this respect.</p>
                  <p>Heere we may consider the end of his comming, the manner of his birth, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of his life, the miracles which he wrought, the doctrine which hee taught, all the circumstances of his humiliation, and sufferings, to the reprochful death vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse, together with his glorious Resurrection and ascension; the manner of his sitting at the right hand of God; the office of his mediation; the gouernment of his Kingdome, with the order of his glorious appearing vnto Iudgement. All these particulars of the sound knowledge of Christ, are so cleerely laid open in the doctrine of his Word, that wee need not
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2803:171"/> now say, (as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8.</note>) <hi>Who shall ascend into Heauen; or who shall des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into the deep? The word is neere, &amp;c.</hi> Now as this is the way that we must go, to come vnto Christ for the partaking of him to our spirituall nourishment, and saluation: and as this is the place where he is to be found: so must we not content our selues to come vnto him after this manner, once, or some fewer times, and when we are at leisure, and haue nothing else to doe, (as is the vse of many) but we must learne dayly to goe after him, and the more wee come vnto him, the more must our loue bee inflamed towards him, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 105.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may heere obserue (to our vnspeakeable comfort) the very great <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>2</label> difference, betwixt this spirituall feode of our soules, and the ordinary meat &amp; drinke of the body. Our earthly meat and drinke, though it be neuer so dainty or delicate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued sparingly, or to the full, yet can it nourish but for a time: Though wee eate
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:2803:172"/> and drinke neuer so plentifully to day, yet shall we bee hungry and thirsty againe to morrow, and haue as much need to refresh our selues as before. Men are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing subiect to sicknesses, and disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to lamenesse, blindnesse, crookednes, old age, and at length are all swallowed vp of death, not one can escape. Yea, and which is more, though men keepe neuer so good a dyet, make neuer so good choise, yet where there is one that liueth vntill he come to old age, many slip away in their flourishing youth, and in the time of their greatest strength. But as for the vertue and efficacy of this spirituall meat of the flesh and bloud Christ Iesus, (eaten and receiued by faith the mouth of the soule) the same is farre otherwise, and hath a farre other manner of operation: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that whosoeuer hath once truely tasted the sweetnesse thereof, receiued, and digested it in his soule, the soule of such a one, euen in this life, shal haue true peace of conscience, sound ioy in the holy Ghost; it shall not not decay in strength, but grow &amp; increase in faith, repentance, patience, loue and al other like sauing and sanctifying graces: and when the time
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:2803:172"/> of their dissolution is come, and the Lord seeth it good to take them out of this life, they shall then first in soule, and then both in body and soule, be made partakers of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. Thus you see, how rightly our Lord Iesus Christ saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.55.</note> that <hi>his flesh is meat indeed, and his bloud is drinke indeed.</hi> As hauing in truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the onely vertue and efficacy of all sound nourishment, and preseruation; all earthly meat and drinke, in comparison thereof, being not worthy the name of meat and drinke, as not able to continue and preserue for any long time; no, not so much as this earthly and transitory life.</p>
                  <p>The last vse then hereupon is this, that <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> seeing there is so great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the food of the body, and the food of the soule: that therefore, as our Sauiour exhorteth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.27.</note>
                     <hi>wee labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which endureth to eternall life:</hi> Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that neither in the abundance, nor in the want of these earthly things, there is any truth or soundnes; but onely in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and heauenly things, purchased and obtained by Iesus Christ. Are we affected with any worldly ioy, vpon any
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:2803:173"/> outward occasion whatsoeuer? Let vs know, that it is not the true ioy, the ioy of the soule is better; the ioy of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome much more surpassing. Are we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with any bodily paine or griefe? Let vs know, that this is not the true afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the griefe of the soule for sinne, is much more grieuous, the paines of hell much farre exceeding. Are wee deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the sweetnesse of any delicious or dainty delicats? Let vs remember, that the flesh of Christ is meat indeed, and the bloud of Christ is drinke indeede: and therefore, consequently, whatsoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this life, we euermore especially hunger and thirst, after that so swéet and heauenly a feeding. These are the vses that wee are to make of this point: and the Lord grant, that thus wee may apply this doctrine, and take comfort by it in our seuerall soules, and not (as the most part doe) preferre earthly vanities, before heauenly pleasures and euerlasting bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse; the food of our bodies, before the foode of our soules, and the saluation of them; the effecting of our owne will and pleasure in the matters of this life, before the aduancement of Gods glory, &amp; the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

                  <head>EXPOSITION.</head>
                  <p>FOr the better vnderstanding of this point: I will consider it in these three branches. First, I will make it appeare, that the Lord God, before the foundation of the world, hath freely in Christ Iesus, elected some to life and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Secondly, that such as are elected, haue the Spirit of Christ, bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with their spirits, that they are of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:2803:174"/> this number. And thirdly, that the Spirit doth thus beare witnesse, by working in them true repentance, and by framing their hearts to beleeue, and obey accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will and Word of God.</p>
                  <p>As touching the first, that the Lord God hath elected a certaine number: it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, where our Sauiour Christ saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.18.</note>
                     <hi>I speake not of you all, I know whom I haue chosen.</hi> And that this was before the foundation of the world, it is plaine, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4.</note> where the Apostle saith in expresse termes; <hi>He hath chosen vs in him,</hi> (that is in Christ) <hi>before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</hi> To this effect also, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</note> And for this cause doth our Lord Iesus Christ affirme, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34</note> that after this manner, shall the sentence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting life bee pronounced at the last Day: <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ye the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> So manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teaching, that they were ordained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto from euerlasting.</p>
                  <p>It is euident also, that this election is onely and altogether of the Lords free goodnes, and meere mercy. For <hi>Iacob</hi> (as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.</note>) nothing
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:2803:174"/> at all deserued to bee preferred before his brother <hi>Esau:</hi> but as our Lord Iesus Christ speaketh, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.26</note> this is euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such was the goodwill and pleasure of God. And according to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, where he teacheth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21</note> that of his méere mercy and grace, through Faith in Christ his Sonne, hee hath chosen and preferred to life, whom he will haue to be saued, and accounted among the iust.</p>
                  <p>And to make it yet more plaine, that <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> onely some are thus chosen in Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world: it may appeare by this; For if God had decreed, to communicate his glory and mercy to all and euery one, then there could be no ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For he that taketh all, cannot bee said to chuse: And therefore saith the Lord, <hi>Math.</hi> 20.<note place="margin">

Our Lord Iesus Christ speaking of such is in the eternall counsell of God, are ordained to life and saluation, and whom he there termeth his sheepe; <hi>I giue vnto them</hi> (saith he) <hi>eternall life;</hi> not to all, but to them.

                     <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast giuen mee, for they are thine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:2803:175"/>
                  <p>Now, if it hee demanded, whether the least, or the greatest number of the sonnes and children of men are thus chosen, and ordained to eternall life: The Text is plaine, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.14.</note> and they are the words of our Lord Iesus Christ himselfe, that <hi>it is a straight gate, and a narrow way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto life, and few there bee that finde it.</hi> The best number is commonly the smallest number. And the Scripture giues great light for the proofe of it in many places. But of this, there can bee no doubt, continuall experience making it apparant.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the second branch, that such as are elected, haue the Spirit of Christ, &amp;c. This is cleerely taught by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">

They onely (I say) haue the Spirit, that is, the gifts and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:2803:175"/> graces of the Spirit: the which Spirit doth not onely make their consciences void of care, quiet, and at peace before God, in the matter of their election and iustification, and in all the temptations and troubles of the world: but guideth and leadeth them also into all truth, both as concerning the knowledge, and the practice of it: assuring them withall of the free forgiuenesse of all their sins, and of the euerlasting saluatiō of their soules▪ <hi>It is God</hi> (saith the Apostle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21, 22.</note>

So that to be assured of election, it is not enough to say, I beleeue in God, or I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Christ: but thou must beleeue in God, and in Christ, as the Word, and Gospell of Christ hath prescribed, and teacheth thee to beleeue. Hereby (I say) thou shalt know, whether the faith which thou hast, be a true faith, and whether the holy Ghost hath framed thy heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, or no. For assure thy selfe, and be out of doubt, if the faith which is in thee, be not grounded vpon the Word &amp; Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Christ, if thou beleeue any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the Word, and Gospel of Christ doth prescribe and teach; thy beliefe is no witnesse of thy election, it is no true faith, it was neuer planted in thy heart by the holy Ghost. For there is euermore such a mutuall relation of faith to the Word of God, as that a true faith can be no more seuered from the Word, then the Sunne-beames from the Sunne: Yea, true faith hangeth vpon the Word of God alone, hath respect vnto, and wholly resteth thereupon.

For although it be left in our power (inasmuch as wee are the Lords reasonable creatures) to will this, or that thing, to reason vpon this or that question, to thinke vpon this or that matter, and to doe this or that worke: yet to will, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to thinke, speake, or doe any thing at all, in such sort as the Lord requireth of his chosen children, and so as the manner of performance may be acceptably recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Christ, as sincere obedience vnto God.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> branches: First, is it so, that God, before the foundation of the world, hath elected a certaine number to life and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? Let vs then examine our selues whether wee be of this number. If wee féele the Spirit of God preuailing in vs against the corrupt lusts, and motions of the flesh, and so as notwithstanding the manifold temptations of the world, the flesh and the deuill, wee first seeke Gods Kingdome, and the righteousnes thereof, and labour more for the meate that endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to eternall life, then for that which perisheth: If we be religiously carefull to make the Word of God the Lanthorne for our féete, and a light for our pathes, and so as we grow in knowledge, faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, zeale of Gods glory, &amp;c. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to such wholsome doctrines, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations as are taught and deliuered: If we be separated from the wicked, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly of the world, and so as wee runne not with them to the wayes of sinne: If we perceiue our selues to be sanctified in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:2803:185"/> all the parts and powers of our soules and bodies, to serue and obey the Lord with true zeale, and feruency of Spirit, according to the rule of his Word. These, and such like, are infallible testimonies of the grace of election, and that wee doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly belong to eternall life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, if wee feele not these, nor any of them in any good measure, our estate is wretched and most miserable, what faire shew soeuer we may carry of a blessed condition in the view of the world. The deuill will suffer any man to say, that he is one of Gods elect, that his sinnes are forgiuen him, and that he hopeth to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but wouldest thou come to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of this indeede, and haue such a proofe of it, as may silence the deuill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe standing against it? Looke then to the holinesse of thy heart and life, according to these few particulars; and if thou be able from thence, to inferre, and conclude thy election; then surely thou art a happy man, and mayst minister such sound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to thy selfe at all times, as will neuer deceiue thee. By the workes of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (I say) make thy election sure, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> counselleth thée, <hi>2. Epist.

And for the further confirmation of this assurance, let this be noted, that whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the holy Ghost dwelleth and abideth, there will he be Lord, gouerning both the heart, minde, will and affections, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing all bad motions vnto sinne, and by stirring vp good motions, and good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, vpon euery occasion: whereupon saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 8.</hi>

And finally, it maketh all such as are endued with it, to grow &amp; flou ish as a greene Garden, and as a tree planted by the riuers of waters, in all the graces of sanctification, not only for their owne peculiar good, and the sure sealing of their owne saluation, but also for the good, and saluation of others, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to euery mans place and calling, and the diuers occasions that are offered. He, that thus feeles the working of Gods Spirit, the same Spirit doth beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with his spirit, that hee is without all question, the elect child of God.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, seeing the holy Spirit of God workes true repentance in all Gods elect, let vs examine also how it is with vs in this particular.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:2803:187"/> belongeth onely to Gods Elect. Whereas on the contrary, if wee cannot finde, and feele these things in any good measure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne in vs, we cannot possibly haue this assurance.</p>

Indéed, the Scripture saith in diuers places, that God will forgiue such as are truely humbled, and cast downe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse and sorrow, in regard of their sins, when, and at what time so euer they doe repent.

                  <p>Whereupon it plainely followeth, not onely that it is an vnlawfull iniunction of the Papists to tye the administration and receiuing thereof vnto certain set dayes in the yeere, and especially vnto Easter: but also a very superstitious obseruation in all such as are more deuout, and ready to communicate at such times, then at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                  <p>There is a double manner of shewing the Lords Death, in the vse and celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament. The first appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the faithfull Ministers of Christ, they not administring the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rightly, and as they ought to doe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they make a declaration of the Lords Death vntill his comming: &amp; that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the whole visible action of breaking, and distributing the Bread and Wine: but in preaching, and declaring out of the Word of God, the end &amp; causes of Christs Death, for to stirre vp the remembrance
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:2803:191"/> of his benefits, to confirme the Faith of the receiuers in the participation of the same: to exhort them to due praise and thanksgiuing, and to vnity and agréement with their fellow members. For, for these causes principally was this Sacrament ordained, as it is manifest in the words of Christs institution.</p>
                  <p>The preaching of the Word therefore, must not bee separated from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which is a seale of the doctrine.) For to make this separation, were as absurd. as if a man should deliuer a Seale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a writing. <label type="milestone">

And whereas it is obiected, that the Sacraments may aswell be administred without preaching at this day, as <hi>Habel</hi> his sacrifice was offred, and the Passeouer celebrated without preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in former time: The answere is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, that the cléere Sacraments of the New Testament in this point of the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs Death, are vnfitly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the obscure figures of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: And yet, had they according to their institution not onely a diuine action,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2803:191"/> or silent ceremony: but also a preaching, and declaration of Christs Death, and of the benefits thereof. And although there be no expresse mention of the forme of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> sacrifice; yet seeing the Scripture te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4.</note> that it was offered by faith, and graciously accepted, and Faith hath alwayes relation to the Word and promise of the Lord: there is no doubt but <hi>Abel</hi> presented his sacrifice with such words as declared his faith in the Seede which was promised to breake the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26, 27.</note>) that the Israelites should declare to their children, the end and vse of the same Sacrament: whereby (though obscurely) yet according to the institution thereof, the Lords death was preached, before he came in the flesh. For this cause (as I said) according to Christs institution, and expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, ought euery Minister cleerely, and plainely, to preach and make declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Death of Christ, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, edification, &amp; comfort of all such as are partakers of the Lords Supper.</p>

And it is performed by them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaning of the Holy Ghost, if they do not only cal to their remembrance the abasing of the Son of God in our flesh, and the most excellent worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, made by the price of his body and bloud: but doe also yeeld vnto him most hearty praise and thankes for the same: and therewithall also, not onely acknowledge themselues to bee his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and of the number of them that looke to be saued, onely by the benefits of Christs death, &amp; by no other meanes at all: but also, that if he had not yeelded his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious body to be crucified, &amp; his precious bloud to be shed: the price of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could not possibly haue bin satisfied; neither could the fierce wrath of GOD haue been appeased: but as wee are by nature the children of wrath; so should we for euer haue remained in the state of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.

And againe, that as surely as the Minister doth giue vnto vs the bread and wine; euen so assuredly we be out of doubt, that the Lord giueth vnto vs the fruits, and benefits of his death and passion, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our soules by faith for our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This faith ought to be in euery true Christian Communicant, or else hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be a worthy receiuer of the Lords Supper. And therefore for this triall and examination, ought euery one to enter into his owne heart, before he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to present himselfe vnto the same.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2803:198"/> According to that also of the Apostle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</note>
                     <hi>Examine your selues whether ye be in the faith, proue your owne selues, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next of all followeth the examination of repentance, and namely, that forasmuch as we sinne daily and hourely against the Lord, in our thoughts, desires, words and actions, whether we finde, and feele in our selues such an vnfayned turning of the whole man from all sinne vnto God, as I haue already spoken of in the three and twentieth question.</p>
                  <p>And last of all, whether there be in vs a settled purpose, and resolution of heart, ioyned with an holy endeuour, to glorifie God, and to seale the assurance of our owne saluation, in all the workes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and righteousnesse, according to euery mans place and calling, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers occasions that are offered? This is that godly and Christian triall, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our selues, which the Apostle commendeth, and whereunto hee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: The which whosoeuer vseth in the feare of God, before hee approach to the Table of the Lord, such a one (by his grace) is a true Christian Communicant. But this is a priuiledge proper onely to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2803:199"/> Gods elect, none being thus religiously carefull to proue and examine themselues beforehand, for a right preparation, but onely they.</p>
                  <p>If any part of this examination be left vnperformed, there cannot possibly be any true prouing of our selues, according to the meaning of the holy Ghost; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently no worthy receiuing of the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>1</label> Lords Supper. For these particulars of knowledge, faith, repentance, and purpose of a godly conuersation, are so strongly linked, and tyed together, as that they cannot be separated: for without the knowledge of our naturall wretchednesse, and of the loue of God the Father, and of our Lord Iesus Christ in the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent worke of our Redemption, there can bee no true faith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Whereas the Apostle, <hi>1.

                  <p>I will not take vpon mee absolutely to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:2803:204"/> determine it: but onely set downe in as few words as I can, what I conceiue, and the reasons of it.</p>
                  <p>They that thinke that <hi>Iudas</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, &amp; receiued the Sacrament of Christs body and bloud, doe ground their perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vpon the words of the Euangelist: where they all agree, that <hi>Iesus sate down with the twelue.</hi> Now <hi>Iudas</hi> (say they) was one of the twelue; and beeing at the Table, as well as the other, there is no doubt, but as well as the other he did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Sacrament. That <hi>Iudas</hi> was one of the twelue, no man can deny, neither do I, that he also sate at the Table: but that he did partake of the Sacrament, I cannot resolue, but incline to the contrary for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reasons.</p>
                  <p>A first reason is out of <hi>Luke 22.</hi> and <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>1.

                  <p>Againe, Christ then promised (as <hi>Mat. <label type="milestone">

                     </hi> sonne. It followeth also in the same Chapter, not onely that after the Soppe, Satan entred into him: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that <hi>as soone as he had receiued the Sop, he went immediately out.</hi> Now, if he went immediatly out, after the receiuing of the Sop, about his Treason: then was hee gone before the institution, &amp; administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament. Whereas then hee sate downe at the Table, it was for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Passeouer. In the eating of the Passeouer, he dipped his hand with Christ in the Dish; and in the eating of the Passeouer did Christ giue him the Soppe.

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:2803:205"/> case (as I verily take it) that hee did not receiue that Sacrament at all.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Euangelist <hi>Luke,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the celebration of the Passeouer, and the institution of the Sacrament, in a whole narratiō, addeth these words of the Lord;<note place="margin">

                  <p>The Euangelist <hi>Luke,</hi> as I noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, goeth on with a narration of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, and of the Lords Supper together, and afterward by way of recapitulation, or rehearsall, returneth againe to the words, which the other Euangelists ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witnesse, to bee spoken before the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Supper.</p>
                  <p>But admit, <hi>Iudas</hi> was present at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of it, &amp; did partake of the same as well as the other: what will follow?</p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:2803:206"/>
                  <p>Why, this, will some say: That as Christ admitted <hi>Iudas</hi> (whom hee knew to be an Hypocrite, a Reprobate, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diuel:) so ought the Minister without difference, &amp; respect, without tryall, and examination, to admit to the Lords Table at this day, such as are notoriously euill, and manifestly lewd, &amp; wicked. For none of such (say they) are worse then <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though I be not peremptory in the former, because I know that some learned men are of a contrary minde: yet this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence I absolutely deny and contradict, as most absurd, and as most iniurious to Christs body and bloud. It is true, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was an Hypocrite, a Reprobate, and a very Diuell; in that sence Christ so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.70.</note>
                     <hi>Ioh. 6.</hi> But if hee were at the Sacrament; to whom was his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, his reprobation, and diuelish practise knowne? And to whom could these things be an offence? It is manifest by the Text, that none of his fellow-Disciples knew him to be such a one: and therefore vnto none of them could he be an offence. Yea, but Christ (will they say) knew him to bee such a vile wretch, and yet admitted him. Well, he thus knew him as he was God,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:2803:206"/> and not as he was Man: and therfore this maketh nothing to the matter. It only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth; that although a man be neuer so very an hypocrite, of neuer so lewd &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked disposition: yet so long as he makes profession of the truth, and is not discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be an hypocrite, but keeps his lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and wickednes secret: so long the Minister ought not to debarre, or repel him from the Communion. This is all that can rightly follow frō Christs exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in admitting <hi>Iudas</hi> to his last Supper, if he did admit him. And after this maner (I make no doubt) but that many hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and wicked liuers, are oftentimes admitted to the partaking of these holy mysteries at this day: yea, euen where the Ministers are most curious, and most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously carefull to separate the vnworthy; It being the proper office onely of God to search the heart, and hidden affections, and not the Ministers, who can labour no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the outward behauiour &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. But for any man to affirme, that the Minister is too precise, transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Christs example, and offereth wrong in excluding, and shutting out such from the Lords Table, as are ignorant of the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2803:207"/> worke of our Redemption, by Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and sufferings; or such whose offences are open, and they knowne to continue in them without repentance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and quality of their transgressions: Besides their impugning herein the Law of the Land, which hath giuen power &amp; authority to the Minister in this behalfe; they become most iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (as I noted before) to the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body and bloud of the Lord,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 7.6.</note> in thus opening gaps for Dogs and Swine to eate and deuoure it. They flatly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the precepts and rules of the Holy Ghost, in diuers places of the Scripture, and oppose their owne partiall and selfe-conceits, against the godly iudgement, and graue authority of all the godly learned that euer were.</p>
